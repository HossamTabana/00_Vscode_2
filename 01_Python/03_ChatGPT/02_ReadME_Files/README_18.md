This involves registering your application with an OAuth2 provider, redirecting a user to the provider's authorization server, and handling the authorization response.                                                                                                                                                                                 | finished_successfully | db795c98-5ca7-4adc-a449-4265ee302286 |

In this case, the preferred method would be to move this logic outside of SSIS into a separate console application written in C# and then call that application from the SSIS package. This may require restructuring your solution, but it will allow you to use a more recent .NET version, and thus, more recent namespaces and functionality.                                                                  |                       |                                      |

The central 'Archive' folder can serve as a repository for retired work that might need referencing in the future.

You'll need to think about how to handle errors, validate and sanitize input, secure sensitive data, and potentially paginate, sort, or filter your data. Additionally, while this example includes a route for getting data (a 'GET' request), you'll likely need to support other types of requests (like 'POST', 'PUT', and 'DELETE') depending on your use case.                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

In Markdown, you generally use forward slashes (`/`) for paths.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

Here's an example if you put your image in the same folder as your Markdown file:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

If you're working in an environment that renders the HTML within Markdown (like GitHub or Jupyter notebooks), you can use HTML tags to control the size of the image.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | finished_successfully | aaa2387c-1b50-4cfc-8ad6-c2769016479c |

For example, some online forums or comment sections that use Markdown might strip out HTML tags for security reasons. Similarly, some static site generators that use Markdown might not support all HTML tags. You'll need to check the specific environment you're using to see if HTML tags are supported.                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

For complex documents with a lot of formatting, you might consider using HTML and CSS directly instead of Markdown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                       |                                      |

At the top of your page, you can place an anchor, and then at the end of each section, you can place a link to that anchor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | finished_successfully | aaa2ba3b-bb1e-4931-bb12-30c42f0abc31 |

When creating nested lists (like the one above), you will need to indent the nested items using a tab or four spaces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

The ID for each subheading is automatically generated based on the text of the subheading. For example, "Step 4: Add Step SQL Data Reader" becomes `#step-4-add-step-sql-data-reader`. Spaces are replaced with hyphens, all characters are converted to lower-case, and the punctuation is removed.                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

In markdown, you create a code block using three back-ticks (`). If you want to specify the syntax highlighting, you can add the language identifier after the opening three back-ticks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | finished_successfully | aaa2401a-4714-4b3d-948a-1d590e0c9452 |

However, standard Markdown syntax does not support sub-step numbering like "3.1", "3.2", etc. You have to manually type those in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | in_progress           | aaa29238-d898-42fe-84a1-1290cef225b6 |

The main heading is `#`, the second level heading is `##`, the third level is `###`, and so on. However, this does not create numbered subheadings like 3.1 or 3.2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | finished_successfully | aaa23b01-ccfb-4bf7-b1e0-9d40d34d2d7f |

This will work as long as the images and the Markdown file are in the same repository.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | finished_successfully | aaa20b58-dea3-4469-83ed-817da01cde73 |

One difference between GitLab's Markdown and standard Markdown is that GitLab's Markdown does not support directly changing image dimensions using HTML tags, like `<img src="" width="" height="">`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | finished_successfully | aaa2c7d1-6ff6-43ef-8ed6-6e305ec8f037 |

There are many tools available that can help you resize an image, such as GIMP, Adobe Photoshop, and even some online tools. Once your image is the right size, you can simply add it to your markdown using the syntax `![alt text](path/to/image)`.                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

This usually involves making a GET request to the API with the URL of your image and the desired dimensions as query parameters. The API will then return the image at the specified size. However, this would involve hosting your images elsewhere and using an external service, which may not be ideal.                                                                          |                       |                                      |

Also, different teams and projects may have different practices for handling images, so you might want to ask your team or project leader if they have a preferred method.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

So far, the system operates effectively. However, we've hit a snag when we attempt to publish the Power BI into the Power BI service. The end users are unable to refresh the data, as Power BI requires us to install the on-premises gateway (Standard edition) on a constantly active server. This gateway operates using HTTPS mode/TLS security.                     |                       |                                      |

The configuration didn't go through due to problems with the proxy configuration and the firewall. After running diagnostic tests and evaluating the results, it became clear that we need to open the ports for specific servers (details attached) and adjust the firewall. As we previously touched upon, we might need to modify the proxy on the server to allow port 443.                                                  |                       |                                      |

While everything has been running smoothly so far, we've encountered a roadblock when we attempt to deploy Power BI into the Power BI service. Due to the Power BI service's requirement for an always-on server with an installed on-premises gateway (Standard edition), our end users are unable to refresh the data. This gateway uses HTTPS mode/TLS security. |                       |                                      |

This is due to complications related to the proxy configuration and firewall. Our diagnosis and the test results indicate that we need to open up specific ports for certain servers (as outlined in the attached document) and make firewall adjustments. In light of our earlier conversation, it appears we might need to tweak the proxy on the server to permit port 443.                                             |                       |                                      |

If the API interactions are complex or not directly supported by Power BI, you might consider setting up an intermediate service to handle the API calls and provide the data in a format readily consumed by Power BI.                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |

In this case, we need to adjust the M script to accommodate this format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | finished_successfully | aaa2c72f-ba10-456d-ae9f-86f7a4095e51 |

This error arises when the function `Table.RenameColumns` gets a list of lists instead of a list of pairs.

The error is happening because of an incorrect comma placement. Here's the corrected code:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | finished_successfully | aaa22ede-072e-420d-8410-4d2d2a39b6e8 |

The error indicates that Power BI cannot find a column with the name 'Column1.0'. It appears that the column names do not follow the "Column1.X" format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | finished_successfully | aaa264c1-8122-4f07-8acb-b03a0a5b611d |
