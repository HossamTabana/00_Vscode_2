These changes will be permanent, and any new Command Prompt windows you open will have these environment variables set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

This could be due to a number of reasons. Here are a few things to check:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | finished_successfully | aaa2b856-c25f-4f35-b4e2-e348c23d1522 |

This is because changes to environment variables do not affect currently open command prompt sessions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

These IDEs often do not recognize changes to environment variables until they are restarted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

|      |                                      |               |               | 3. **User vs system variables**: The `setx` command without any options sets a user environment variable. User environment variables are available only to the user for whom they are set, while system environment variables are available system-wide. If you're running your Python script under a different user account, it won't have access to user environment variables set under your account. In this case, you can try setting system environment variables using the `/M` option of the `setx` command, like this: `setx /M SQL_SERVER KFICWPNXDBSP01`. Please note that you need administrative privileges to set system environment variables. |                       |                                      |

If your value is longer than this, it can cause problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

You can then add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore` to ensure that it is not tracked by version control. This approach also makes it easier to manage your environment variables if you have a lot of them, or if their values change frequently.                                                                                                                                                                                 |                       |                                      |

In the batch file, you will use the `set` command to set environment variables instead of `setx`. Unlike `setx`, `set` only sets the environment variables for the current command prompt session and does not save them permanently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | finished_successfully | aaa22ba1-6505-497a-8805-b4cafbec7c03 |

When you are transferring the environment to a different machine, this path might not be applicable because the user directory or Anaconda installation path could be different.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | finished_successfully | aaa20c1e-d6d4-4ab6-a718-aeacd0cd2d55 |

It installs the new environment in the default location for the current Anaconda installation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                       |                                      |

This will not affect the creation of the environment, as Conda determines the necessary dependencies and packages from the other parts of the `.yml` file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

You can manually delete the environment's directory. In your case, the path to the directory is `C:\Users\IBRAHHO\Anaconda3\envs\prod2`. Be cautious when manually deleting directories to avoid removing important files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |

When you create a new environment using the `conda env create -f environment.yml` command, Conda creates the new environment in the default directory for environments (`~/anaconda3/envs/` on Unix-based systems or `C:\Users\{username}\Anaconda3\envs\` on Windows), using the name specified in the .yml file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | finished_successfully | aaa24e9b-9549-4611-91f2-4824126ab29e |

For instance, when loading data into Power BI, it may execute the source query twice – once for the actual data load, and once for a row count (to estimate how much data it's dealing with). This is especially noticeable when the data source query has side effects (like incrementing a counter or writing to a log).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

As part of the data loading process, Power BI often runs the Python/R scripts multiple times. The first run is to get the schema, and subsequent runs are to fetch the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | finished_successfully | aaa22b35-c97d-433f-bf6f-29b41bb825fb |

Then you can adjust your script to check this database or file at the beginning of its execution and use the stored results if they exist instead of performing the operation again. This way, the expensive part of your script will only be executed once.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

As Power BI is continuously updated and improved, newer versions may offer a more direct solution to this problem. Therefore, it is always a good idea to keep your software updated and check the official documentation for the latest features and best practices.                                                                                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |

This script will indeed be run multiple times by Power BI during the data loading process, which is part of its process for understanding and fetching the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | finished_successfully | aaa2e21c-3709-4f4b-aa06-18ab9137782f |

To mitigate this, you can implement the caching solution I suggested in my previous responses. However, in your case, the situation is a bit more complex, because you're not just fetching data, you're also executing a dynamically fetched script.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                       |                                      |

If you are experiencing automatic refreshes every time you add a new Python script, it might be due to Power BI's default behavior to refresh data when changes are detected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | finished_successfully | d444b673-bf1f-49e7-bfda-64ce3e779f0e |

If your date-time is in a column, for instance, called `datetime_column` in a table named `my_table`, you can extract the year using the `year()` function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | finished_successfully | aaa21f88-784e-4f82-9a39-50e9f12cfb2d |

Then we take the maximum of these values for each `dpvoyage`. If the maximum is 1, this means that there is at least one event '000' for the `dpvoyage`, and we assign 'Y' to the `new_column`. If the maximum is 0, this means there are no events '000', and we assign 'N' to the `new_column`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |

If the counts are equal, then all locations have event = '000'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | finished_successfully | 86bc5455-6a57-4e55-a1b2-0cedd04b9083 |

Here's how you could structure the query:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | finished_successfully | dedf674f-0d89-49be-9731-06e184e3902f |

Window functions are applied after the `GROUP BY` clause, which is why they can't be used in combination directly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | finished_successfully | aaa268d8-2a0e-445e-abfd-dccb7b7e7fe7 |

The environment it operates within is isolated and sandboxed for security reasons, and it doesn't directly allow calling out to other scripting languages or system-level tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | finished_successfully | aaa2b1a3-1cb4-438d-b1b5-3b15c8314c6a |

For instance, in SQL Server, you could create a stored procedure that runs a PowerShell script, which then captures the output and stores it in a SQL table. Later, you can fetch that data using Power BI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                       |                                      |

It allows execution of any command line code from within SQL Server, which can be a threat if SQL Server is compromised. However, if you understand the risks and still want to use `xp_cmdshell`, you can enable it by using the `sp_configure` command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | finished_successfully | aaa2dfc5-1f92-47c9-81bd-b60e67c1d739 |

In Power BI Python scripts, the return value should be a DataFrame, not a print statement. This is because Power BI treats Python as a data source and hence, expects tabular data in return.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | finished_successfully | aaa296e2-873d-44bc-b9e6-13005f0b41b5 |

If it isn't, we execute the SQL query. However, if `UserName` is null (indicating the user isn't logged in), we return a single row table with an "Error" column and a message saying "You don't have permission to run the report". This error table will be displayed in place of the report data in Power BI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |

With RLS, you can control which data a user sees in a Power BI report based on their role, which could be mapped to their Windows user ID. Here's how you might approach this:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                       |                                      |

Then assign these roles to your users. This can be done through the 'Modeling' tab in Power BI Desktop.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                       |                                      |

This can be done by selecting the 'Manage Roles' option from the 'Modeling' tab, then creating a new role. For each role, you define DAX expressions that return a Boolean value. If the value is true, the row is visible to users in that role.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                       |                                      |

However, it's important to note that Power BI doesn't directly interact with Windows user credentials while making SQL server data requests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | finished_successfully | aaa2a7ca-a35f-441b-bd8f-1edde62d2861 |

This parameter can then be used in your Power Query. However, capturing the Windows User ID dynamically in Power BI Desktop isn't straightforward.

Therefore, this approach works best in a strictly Power BI Desktop environment where each user has their own copy of the .pbix file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |

So, when you save your script in a text editor like Notepad, you can name it something like `UsernameScript.ps1`. Be sure to change the "Save as type" dropdown to "All Files (\*.\*)" to allow custom file extensions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | finished_successfully | aaa2a627-3a6a-486d-80fa-2cfd3ce746f3 |

However, you can use the Qlik Sense APIs or other workarounds to indirectly run Python scripts and bring the results into your Qlik application. Here's an example workflow:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | finished_successfully | a263f0c0-3400-4f62-ad7c-eb777ce4aeef |

Use a framework like Flask to make this easier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

Enter the URL of your API, and then choose POST as the method. In the 'Body' field, enter the data you want to send to the API in JSON format. Then load the data and use it in your application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |

You should also consider error handling, data privacy, and security concerns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                       |                                      |
