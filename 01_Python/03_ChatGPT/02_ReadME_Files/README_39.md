Use a third-party connector: You can try using a third-party connector, such as the QVD Extractor for Alteryx by Analytics8. This connector allows you to read and write QVD files in Alteryx without the need for the Qlik Connector.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                       |                                      |

Convert the QVD file to a different format: You can convert the QVD file to a different format that Alteryx supports, such as CSV or Excel. To do this, you can use a tool like QlikView or Qlik Sense to export the data to a different format. Once you have the data in a supported format, you can use the "Input Data" tool in Alteryx to read the file.                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

Use Alteryx's QVD Input/Output macros: Alteryx provides QVD Input/Output macros that allow you to read and write QVD files without the need for the Qlik Connector. To use these macros, you need to download and import them into your Alteryx workflow. You can find more information on how to do this in the Alteryx documentation.                                                                                                                 |                       |                                      |

If your columns are named differently, you will need to adjust the script accordingly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

The `generate_response()` function looks up the user's query in the JSON file and returns a random response from the list of possible responses. The code then enters a loop that repeatedly prompts the user for input and generates a response using the `generate_response()` function. |                       |                                      |

To fix this, you can modify the code that converts the responses to a one-hot encoded format as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | finished_successfully | bc2d5c9c-3e58-4ad0-9287-c12df8846fbc |

The `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'` error occurs when you try to use a list as a key in a dictionary, which is not allowed because lists are mutable and therefore cannot be hashed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | finished_successfully | 1c49f0cd-d526-4cbd-b23f-6d3a685d979b |

In this case, the `set(responses)` operation will not work because sets can only contain hashable types, and lists are not hashable.                                                                                                                                | finished_successfully | bcc4429c-7ea3-4829-a032-f926b594da1b |

Increase the size of the training data: One of the main reasons for low accuracy could be insufficient training data. You could consider adding more training data to improve the accuracy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

Use a pre-trained word embedding: Instead of training an embedding layer from scratch, you could use a pre-trained embedding such as GloVe or Word2Vec. Pre-trained embeddings have been trained on large amounts of data and can often lead to better accuracy.                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

Use a different architecture: Instead of using a simple LSTM model, you could try using a more complex architecture such as a bidirectional LSTM or a transformer model such as BERT or GPT-2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |

Experiment with hyperparameters: You could try experimenting with different hyperparameters such as the learning rate, batch size, or number of epochs to see if that improves the accuracy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

This means that the pre-trained word embeddings will not be updated during training, which can be useful if you have limited training data. If you have a large amount of training data, you may want to set `trainable` to `True` to allow the model to learn more accurate embeddings during training.           |                       |                                      |
