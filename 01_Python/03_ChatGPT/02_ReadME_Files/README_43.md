The subroutine then uses a For loop to iterate through the rows of the table and find the maximum value in the specified column that meets the specified condition. The result is returned as the result of the subroutine using the "Return" statement. |                       |                                      |

By doing so, you can simplify your script and reduce the amount of redundant code.                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

The table names are stored in the "vTables" array, and the field names and associated table names are stored in the "vFields" array. The arrays are then loaded into a temporary table "TempTable". The final table contains both the table names and field names, with the table names having a "-" value in the "FieldName" column.                                                      |                       |                                      |
