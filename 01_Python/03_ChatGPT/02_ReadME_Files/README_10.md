Also, in a production environment, you would need to consider setting up logging, monitoring, restarting, and HTTPS. The steps above show a very basic deployment, and are not suitable for a production environment.                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

Inside the directory, create a Python file called `get_data.py` (or any other name you prefer) and paste your code into it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

This file is necessary for Python to recognize the directory as a package. This file can be empty or can contain valid Python code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

However, it involves a slightly different process which is packaging your Python code as a conda package.

This means you will need to generate a personal access token to use in place of a password.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | finished_successfully | aaa250d3-039f-43cc-afab-3abebe5a00af |

Enter your GitHub username as usual, but at the password prompt, paste your personal access token instead of your password.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                       |                                      |

If you initialized your repository on GitHub and it automatically created a `main` branch, while your local repository uses the `master` branch, you'll need to push your changes to the `main` branch instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | finished_successfully | aaa20663-618d-4c1b-8031-f21cc548da26 |

However, pushing a local repository (on your computer) to a GitHub repository can't be done directly from the web interface. For this, you would need to use the Git command line or a Git GUI client.                                                                                                                                                                                        | finished_successfully | aaa231ea-26b3-4ad9-bfb9-f1c8bd607422 |

Now `main` will be your default branch, you can confirm this from the main page of your repository, it should say `main` instead of `master`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                       |                                      |

You would still need to change the branch name in your local repository. You can do this with the command:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                       |                                      |

However, if they download the .pbix file and open it in Power BI Desktop, they can access the Python scripts.                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |

You can then call the functions from that package within your Power BI Python script. The downside is that you would have to set up a Python environment with the package installed on each machine that needs to run the Power BI report.                                                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |

We'll name the package `mypackage`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | finished_successfully | aaa2d1fc-bc71-42f8-8137-4046b83aa4c2 |

You are correct; after running `python setup.py sdist`, the distribution file is named following the convention `<package_name>-<version>.tar.gz`. In your case, it is `mypackage-0.1.tar.gz`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | finished_successfully | aaa27e33-eae7-4eac-b5e7-dc6517b77849 |

It appears that the directory where `mypackage` is installed is included in the Python path. This suggests that the package is installed correctly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | finished_successfully | aaa23daa-5503-4711-ad28-6f50f924a8eb |

Sometimes, the kernel might not pick up newly installed packages until it is restarted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |

If you are using a Jupyter Notebook, check if the package is installed in the same virtual environment that the notebook is using.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

Python is case-sensitive, so `mypackage` and `MyPackage` would be considered as different package names.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

Let's try some additional troubleshooting steps:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

Sometimes, multiple Python installations or environments can lead to import issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

Check if your package is installed in a namespace and modify the import accordingly. For example, if `mypackage` is installed in a namespace called `mypackages`, you would import it like this:                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

It seems that the package installation directory is not listed in the Python path. This is likely the reason why the `ModuleNotFoundError` occurs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | finished_successfully | aaa2c022-2fd2-4661-add0-86722d75e8cc |

Activate the conda environment where `mypackage` was installed, and then run your Jupyter Notebook or Python script within that environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

It appears that `mypackage` is listed in the output, which means it is installed in your current Python environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | finished_successfully | aaa2b988-d913-49d5-98c4-3ec8f070a732 |

It's lightweight, serverless, and requires minimal setup. To connect with SQLite, you can use the `sqlite3` module that comes pre-installed with Python.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | finished_successfully | aaa26970-2a66-44a7-b0fc-3593f1d1b68c |

You can then use python-dotenv to load the variables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

The Python script can then decrypt the credentials to connect to the database. This method is a bit more complex and is usually not necessary if you control the environment where the script is running.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

If you need to provide database access to others, it's a better practice to create a separate database user for them with the minimal required permissions.                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

This server knows the database credentials and can query the database. The server performs the necessary query and sends the result back to the Python script.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

In this case, you will still need to share the service account credentials with the other person, but you can control what data and operations the service account has access to.                                                                                  |                       |                                      |

I would recommend looking into Flask's extensive documentation to learn more about these topics.                                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |

I have used it here for simplicity. In a real-world scenario, you should define more specific API endpoints that correspond to specific database operations, rather than executing raw SQL directly.                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

Never expose this to the public internet without proper security measures. It's advisable to use HTTPS protocol for API communication. You may want to use a production-ready server like Gunicorn or uWSGI in front of your Flask application for better performance and security.                                                                                                                                  |                       |                                      |

If the server's IP address is `203.0.113.0`, the URL would be `http://203.0.113.0:5000/query`. If you have a domain name like `example.com`, the URL would be `http://example.com:5000/query`.                                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

If they're on the same machine, use `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as the address. If they're on different machines, ensure that the server's firewall is not blocking incoming connections and that you're using the correct IP address or hostname to connect.                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

By default, Flask runs on port 5000, so the URL should be `http://<server-address>:5000/query`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                       |                                      |

If it's on a local network, it should be reachable on the network. If it's on a remote server, it should be reachable over the internet (assuming the firewall and networking rules allow it).                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

This means that it's trying to connect to a server on the same machine. If the Flask server isn't running on the same machine, you'll need to update the script to use the correct IP address or hostname. If the Flask server is running on the same machine, ensure that it's running correctly and listening on port 5000.                                                                                          |                       |                                      |

Always sanitize and validate your inputs to prevent SQL injection attacks, and restrict the queries that can be run via this endpoint. Ideally, set up different specific endpoints for each kind of operation you want to allow on your database. This setup here is a simple example and should not be used as is in a production environment without further security measures. |                       |                                      |

You would need to set up an OAuth 2.0 provider to issue tokens for your clients, and then validate these tokens on every request to your API.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | finished_successfully | aaa2bdd4-3125-485c-ac5e-59dff143708a |

With Authlib, you can either create an OAuth2 provider, which means creating a server that can provide access tokens to clients, or you can create an OAuth2 client, which means creating a client that can obtain access tokens from a provider.                                                                                                                                                            | finished_successfully | aaa28727-7bf1-490e-8b79-1011c80e3955 |

Instead, they're stored in environment variables, which can be set separately in each environment where you run your script. This makes your script more flexible and secure, since you don't have to include the actual connection details in the script.                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

In Windows, you can use the `set` command to set environment variables for the current session from the command line.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | finished_successfully | aaa27d06-a066-4352-bbef-6feea66a0002 |

This is typically because the environment variables haven't been set correctly or the script can't access them for some reason.                                                                                                                                                                                             | finished_successfully | aaa2bdaf-4eb5-43a2-bba0-23ca4c03f05b |

If you set the variables in one command prompt session and then open a new command prompt to run your script, the new session won't have access to the environment variables you set in the previous session.                                                                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

If you're trying to set the environment variables permanently through System Properties, make sure to restart your command prompt after setting them. Changes to system environment variables don't take effect until you start a new command prompt session.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                       |                                      |

If you're running your script in an IDE (like PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, etc.), you might need to set the environment variables in a different way, or restart the IDE after setting the environment variables in System Properties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |
