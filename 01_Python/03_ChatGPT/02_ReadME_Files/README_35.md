The syntax is incorrect: Make sure that you're entering the correct syntax for specifying all schemas in the database. The syntax is `DatabaseName.*`. For example, if the name of the database is "MyDatabase", you should enter "MyDatabase.*" in the "Database" field.                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

Try uninstalling and reinstalling the extension, or try using a different extension.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                       |                                      |

The `os.listdir()` function returns a list of all the files and directories in the specified path. You can then use a `for` loop to iterate over the list and print the names of the files or directories. The `r` before the path string is used to indicate that it is a raw string and to ignore any special characters in the string.                       |                       |                                      |

Make sure that the syntax of these functions is correct and that they are being used appropriately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

Find the input parameters of the stored procedure, and execute the stored procedure with those same input parameters manually using a SQL query. This will allow you to narrow down which part of the stored procedure is causing the conversion error.                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

When the query fails with the conversion error, look at the value of the variable that is being converted from `VARCHAR` to `NUMERIC`. Check if the value is a valid number, and if not, identify the source of the incorrect data.                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

For example, if the data is being imported from a file or another database, ensure that the data types in the source match the data types in the destination database.                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               | 4. If the data is coming from another database, try casting the data to the correct data type before inserting it into the target database. For example, you can use the `CAST` or `CONVERT` functions in SQL to convert data types.                                                                                                                                                                                      |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               | 5. If the issue is not with the data itself, review the stored procedure for any conversion functions or expressions that may be causing the issue. Ensure that the syntax of the function is correct and that it is being used appropriately.                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

Review the `REPLACE` function used to remove the comma and period from the `[Amount in doc curr]` and `[Amount in loc curr 2]` fields. Ensure that the `REPLACE` function is removing only the desired characters and that there are no invalid characters in the field values.                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

If the issue is not with the data itself, try casting the field values to the correct data type before using the `REPLACE` function to remove the commas and periods. For example, you can use the `CAST` or `CONVERT` functions in SQL to convert data types.                                                                                                                                                         |                       |                                      |

If the compatibility level is not set to the appropriate version, it may cause data type conversion issues.                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

Make sure that the data format in these fields is consistent and can be converted to `DECIMAL` data type. If the issue persists, review other steps mentioned above to narrow down the issue.                                      |                       |                                      |

The LET statements create variables for the name of the sales table and the year, which are used in the subsequent LOAD statement to filter the data.                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

Then we use a `FOR` loop to iterate through each year in the SOS column, starting from the current year and going backwards until the earliest year in the data.                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

We then use the `STORE` command to create the new QVD file with this name.                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

We load this filtered data into a new table with the same name as the QVD file we just created (e.g. `sales_2023`). This table is automatically appended to the previous table(s) created in previous iterations of the loop using the `Concatenate()` function. |                       |                                      |

You're correct that the `Concatenate` function is used to concatenate tables, not create variable names. Instead, you can use the `&` operator to concatenate strings to create the variable name for the QVD file.                                                                                                                                                                        | finished_successfully | 0a3dfc3b-0b94-48b3-92e7-1fd2da9c7fab |

It seems that the table `FACTCHAT_2023` was not created in the previous iteration of the loop. This could happen if there was no data in the original QVD file for the year 2023.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | finished_successfully | af34caad-6495-44de-9ad0-1cfd75491c7e |

To fix the "Table not found" error, you need to make sure that the concatenated table for the current year is created before trying to store it as a QVD file.                                                                                                                                                                                             | finished_successfully | 3ee92186-8761-4f5e-b6ac-44249132fe93 |

You can also try to change the path to a different location and see if the QVD files get generated there.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                       |                                      |

You can search for all QVD files in the folder where you are trying to store them and see if there are any files with a similar name.                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

You can add a message box or log statement in the script to verify if the `STORE` command is being executed for each iteration of the loop.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                       |                                      |

You are correct that the `where` clause should not be included in the `STORE` command.

We then iterate through each year in the `SOS` column using the `Min` and `Max` functions. For each year, we filter the data based on the year using the `WHERE` clause and load it into a new table named `Sales_<year>`. We then store this table as a QVD file using the `STORE` command and drop the table to free up memory.                |                       |                                      |

You are correct that the `qvd, replace` parameters should be removed from the `STORE` command.

We then filter the data for the current year using the `WHERE` clause and load it into a new table named `Sales_<year>`. We store this table as a QVD file using the `STORE` command and drop the table to free up memory.                                                                              |                       |                                      |

If the column you want to split your QVD file on is called `SOS`, you can update the script as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | finished_successfully | ac6f74c6-22ea-4515-9994-1b66ebcee1bc |

We then filter the data for the current year using the `WHERE` clause and load it into a new table named `Sales_<year>`. We store this table as a QVD file using the `STORE` command and drop the table to free up memory.                                                                                 |                       |                                      |

Make sure the Python script file ('untitled0.py') is saved in the correct directory ('C:\Users\Public\copy_files_ibrahho\Sales_Performance\qvd_master'). If it is not saved there, move the file to the correct directory or update the directory path in your command prompt or batch file.                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

If you are running the script from a command prompt, make sure to navigate to the correct directory before running the script. You can do this using the 'cd' command.
