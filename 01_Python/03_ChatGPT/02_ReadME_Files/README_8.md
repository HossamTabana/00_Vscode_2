However, they do need to comply with certain requirements. They must not exceed a maximum speed of 20 km/h (12.4 mph), must have a bell or similar warning device, and two independent brakes. Furthermore, riding on sidewalks or in pedestrian zones is generally not permitted, except where expressly allowed by additional signage.                        | finished_successfully | e21aa6a1-776b-4ec6-8d9f-b1a0513e428e |

You can do this by checking the list of drivers in the ODBC Data Source Administrator (`odbcad32.exe`), which you can find by searching for it in the Windows search bar. If the driver is installed, it should be listed there. Make sure that the name of the driver in the connection string matches exactly with the name listed in the ODBC Data Source Administrator. The names are case-sensitive and any difference could cause this error.                                           |                       |                                      |

Similarly, if you're using a 32-bit version of Python, make sure you have the 32-bit version of the ODBC driver installed. The bit version of the Python interpreter and the ODBC driver must match.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |

If the ODBC driver is installed correctly and is compatible with your Python version, but the issue persists, it could be due to a problem with your Python environment. If you are using a virtual environment, you might try deactivating it and running the script in the base Python environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                       |                                      |

It can leave your program vulnerable to injection attacks. Also, `pymssql` is considered less maintained and less recommended compared to `pyodbc`, so if you're working on a production system, I highly recommend trying to resolve the ODBC issues or consult with your system administrator.                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

The `pymssql` library, which I've suggested as an alternative, doesn't rely on ODBC and hence shouldn't produce the `IM002` error code which is related to ODBC connections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | finished_successfully | aaa23fb6-9ab9-43c4-90b4-925f8c722a36 |

If your machine doesn't have an ODBC driver installed and you don't want to install one, you'll need to switch to a library like `pymssql`, which doesn't rely on ODBC.                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

If you have control over the database-stored script, or if you can retrieve it and adjust it before running, I recommend replacing any ODBC-based connections with an equivalent that doesn't require ODBC. If you don't have control over the script, you'll need to reach out to whoever maintains it.                                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |

For example, `pyodbc` may default to Windows authentication while `pymssql` may default to SQL Server authentication. If your SQL Server is configured to use Windows authentication, you might need to specify that you want to use SQL Server authentication when connecting via `pymssql`. Check the `pymssql` documentation or consult with your database administrator to understand if this could be causing the problem. |                       |                                      |

For example, in Python strings, the backslash character (`\`) is an escape character. If your password contains any special characters, try escaping them by adding an extra backslash before them (`\\`), or put the password in a raw string by prefixing it with an 'r' (`r"password"`).                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

If the server name contains special characters or spaces, try enclosing it in square brackets (e.g., `[My Server]`). If your server name includes an instance name, make sure to include it as well (e.g., `server\\instance`).                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

There might be some specific configurations or restrictions on your SQL Server that are preventing `pymssql` from connecting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

The username or password might be incorrect, the user might not have permissions to connect from your current location, the SQL Server might not be configured to allow SQL Server authentication, or there could be some other configuration issue. For these kinds of issues, you might need to talk to your database administrator.                           |                       |                                      |

So, it should be fine as is. But if there's an instance name, you should include it. For instance, if the server name is `KFICWPNXDBSP01` and the instance name is `SQLEXPRESS`, you would format it like this:                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

Also, pymysql.connect() does not accept connection strings directly, you need to pass the parameters separately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | finished_successfully | aaa2a5f9-c52c-4b14-a5f6-65f790664d1a |

The function `connect_to_database()` has been modified to call this new function and pass the resulting server, username, password, and database name to `pymysql.connect()`. Finally, `pymysql.connections.Connection` objects use the `.db` attribute to access the name of the connected database, not `.database`.                      |                       |                                      |

When you do `os.environ['192.168.1.67']`, it is trying to find an environment variable named '192.168.1.67', which probably doesn't exist. You're not supposed to put the actual values (like the IP address, the username, the password, etc.) inside the `os.environ[]` function. Instead, you should put the name of the environment variable that holds these values.                                                                                         |                       |                                      |

If you're running the script from an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm or VS Code, ensure the environment variables are available to the IDE. You might need to set the environment variables in the configuration settings of the IDE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |

If you want the environment variables to persist across terminal sessions, consider adding the export commands to your shell's profile script (e.g., `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, or `.zshrc` for the Bash or Zsh shells). Once added, you can load the new environment variables into your current session using the `source` command:                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

And do not commit your `.env` file or `launch.json` file containing sensitive information (like passwords) into version control. You might want to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to ensure it doesn't get committed.                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

Happy learning!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |
