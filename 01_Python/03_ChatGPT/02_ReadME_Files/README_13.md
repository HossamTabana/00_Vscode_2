This is typically not recommended as it can lead to unexpected behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | finished_successfully | aaa217cc-182b-46ca-a7b7-cadfe7d001a5 |

The DataFrame `df` is used to accumulate the results of the API calls, so we can move its initialization outside the loop. If the API limit is reached, we can store the error message in a different DataFrame:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                       |                                      |

There are multiple ways to achieve this, but for this case, I will use a simple approach: Store the count and the date in a file. Each time we're about to make a request, we will check this file. If the date is not today, we reset the count to 0.

This file will keep track of the date and the count of API calls. Whenever `fetch_data()` is called, it loads this file and checks the date. If the date isn't today's date, it resets the count to 0 and updates the date. If the count is already 30 or more, it stops making requests for the day. Otherwise, it makes the API call and increments the count, then saves the updated count and date back to the file. |                       |                                      |

To track API calls, you could leverage the `DateTime` function to generate a unique identifier for each day and use Alteryx's ability to read and write data to keep track of the count of API calls. Here's a possible way to do it:                                                                                                                         | finished_successfully | 2adaea3d-d1fe-4b2e-bfa3-29aa19c5322d |

Optimized loads can only occur under certain circumstances, such as when no transformations are applied to the QVD data during load. The use of `WHERE EXISTS` clause counts as a transformation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

This way, they are not hard coded into your program, and they can be securely accessed by your script when needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                       |                                      |

In this case, since you're the one encrypting the data, it should be safe, but in general, you should avoid using `eval()` with untrusted data. If you're uncomfortable with using `eval()`, you could alternatively use `json.dumps()` and `json.loads()` to convert the dictionary to a string and back.                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

And keep in mind the limitations of this approach that I mentioned in my previous messages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                       |                                      |

Remember to secure this key properly because if anyone gets this key, they can decrypt your data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | finished_successfully | aaa224b9-9ce2-4dd1-986d-a9178b94d9dd |

The key is not tied to any specific session or runtime instance of your script. This is why it's important to keep the key secure and private, because anyone who has access to the key can decrypt your data.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | finished_successfully | aaa2cb5d-361e-4b86-bfa9-4979993b331a |

Then, the end user would be able to run the decryption function to decrypt the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | finished_successfully | aaa2dfa1-2d1e-42da-81a1-cea992a51ff4 |

This means that if you're trying to keep the `auth_url` and `auth_data` secret from the end user, this method won't work, because the end user will be able to decrypt the `auth_url` and `auth_data`.                                                                                                                                                                 |                       |                                      |

That way, the end user would only ever communicate with your proxy server and not directly with the API, and your proxy server could safely store the `auth_url` and `auth_data` without exposing them to the end user.                                                                                      |                       |                                      |

For that, you would need to use a different approach, like setting up a proxy server as I mentioned in the previous message.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

However, it's important to note that anyone with the decryption key and knowledge of your encryption method can still decrypt the data. If the end user can't be trusted with the decrypted data, they also can't be trusted with the encrypted data and the decryption key.                                                                                                                                                  | finished_successfully | aaa2abc6-bb91-4d6e-81d0-929eb82c9e50 |

But this would just be a form of security through obscurity, and it wouldn't stop a determined end user from decoding and decrypting the data.                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

Unfortunately, as of my last update in September 2021, there is no such package available. Python can easily handle CSV and Parquet files using packages like pandas, but QVD is a proprietary format of QlikView and not directly supported in Python.                                                                                                                                                                                           | finished_successfully | aaa212b6-6ec5-4b29-9c3b-fa16c0b5687c |

Also, QlikView can be scripted and run in a batch mode, so you could automate the process to some extent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

This is something that would be highly specific to your setup and would require familiarity with QlikView's scripting and automation capabilities.                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

However, a feasible workaround would be using QlikView's own scripting capabilities to convert QVD files into CSV, and then read CSV with Python and convert it to Parquet format.                                                                                                                                                               | finished_successfully | aaa277e6-c6ce-424e-8e08-ebc62d6e0c91 |

QlikView itself doesn't have a Python API, so launching QlikView as a background process with Python might not work as you expect. You would typically use QlikView's script editor to write scripts that convert QVD to CSV.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

However, QlikView provides APIs for other languages like VBScript and JavaScript, which you can use to control QlikView from within a Python script using a library like `pywin32` to interact with the COM interface.                                                                                                                            | finished_successfully | aaa231c3-89d6-45e4-9131-b20df4fb2a25 |

You would need to use QlikView to export the data to a CSV or other intermediate format that Python can handle, and then use Python to convert that data into the final format you want.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

Therefore, you would need to use a workaround or another solution for reading QVD files. There are also no known QlikView APIs or libraries in Python that allow opening QlikView and performing tasks in it directly from Python.                                                                                                                                                              | finished_successfully | aaa26bb9-8e33-47b9-8397-4cda6bbd34df |

However, you can run command-line instructions using Python, which would allow you to use the QlikView Desktop Client's CLI capabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | finished_successfully | aaa273a0-074d-4a9f-943a-fa6a08417693 |

There are a few packages like `qvdreader` that can be used to read .qvd files in Python. However, the splitting into chunks and saving as .csv or .parquet files can be done in Python using pandas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

For the best results, you should consider using QlikView's built-in scripting language or API directly.                                                                                   |                       |                                      |

First, QlikView does not have a direct Python interface for running QlikView scripts, you might need a specific QlikView automation tool for this. Additionally, QlikView's qv.exe doesn't support command line operations, so it can't be invoked directly from a Python script.                                                                                                                         | finished_successfully | aaa26e67-d91b-426f-a71c-3b2a23bfa5b3 |

But it's important to understand that this kind of automation is prone to errors and might not work consistently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

You might need to find or develop a QlikView to CSV converter yourself, or use QlikView itself to export the data as CSV and then use Python to process that data.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

Unfortunately, as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, there is no API or library to directly interact with QlikView documents (.qvw files) using Python. The main reason is that QlikView is a proprietary software, and the execution of scripts inside QlikView (to load data from QVD and save it to CSV) is not exposed to external programming languages or scripts. | finished_successfully | aaa2fc6f-965a-434c-bd5e-ecff0e1e5027 |

This usually involves setting up a task in the QlikView Management Console (QMC) to execute a script inside a QlikView document, then triggering that task from external code. Note that this method will still require you to create and configure the QlikView document and script manually.                                                                            |                       |                                      |

One way, as you mentioned, is by writing the data to a location like an S3 bucket and then accessing it from your BI tool. Here's how you can write your DataFrame to an S3 bucket:                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | finished_successfully | aaa2249f-6706-4425-bc15-bb5524000b51 |

The "overwrite" mode in Delta Lake will replace the current content of the Delta table with the new data. In contrast, the "append" mode will keep the current content and add the new data to the Delta table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | finished_successfully | aaa2811c-a3ee-4337-ac84-0f56a3b5ccf9 |
