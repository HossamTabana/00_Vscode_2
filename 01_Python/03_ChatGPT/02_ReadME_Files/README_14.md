The returned lambda function multiplies its argument by `n`. So, `double` is a function that doubles its argument, and `triple` is a function that triples its argument.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

Therefore, it's often more readable and concise. This is particularly useful for simple operations that can be performed in a single expression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

This makes them easy to use when you need a function for a short period of time, particularly as arguments to higher-order functions that take other functions as inputs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

The difference is mainly syntactic, meaning that the way you write them differs, but they're compiled to the same bytecode when the program runs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | finished_successfully | ff056bb6-e169-43d3-83e9-d2b914142b89 |

The speed of your code usually depends more on what you do in the function rather than whether you define it using `def` or `lambda`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

For complex logic, a regular function would be the better option, and it would not have any performance disadvantage compared to a lambda function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

Here's how you can do it:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | finished_successfully | 017bd111-18c9-469e-b475-31927b1955cc |

Here is how you can do it:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

These part files are created because the data is partitioned across multiple nodes in your Spark cluster for parallel processing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | finished_successfully | aaa238e8-d499-4232-b4b2-18117b81567c |

Note that this may not be ideal if your dataset is large as it could lead to a performance bottleneck because all the data must be processed by a single node. Also, be aware that even though you repartition the data to a single file, Databricks will still append a unique identifier to the filename to prevent collisions between different write operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

If you specifically want the output to be a parquet file named "latest_tt1850.parquet", you might need to write some additional code to rename the output file after it has been saved. As of now, this isn't directly supported in Databricks or Spark due to the distributed nature of the file system. You would need to use AWS SDKs such as boto3 for renaming the files after they have been saved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                       |                                      |

Most tools can interact with distributed file systems (like Amazon S3) directly and understand that the data is split across multiple part files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | finished_successfully | aaa259eb-3b4a-4dcb-8e38-235fed71c6be |

However, Power BI does offer an API for developers, known as the Power BI REST API. You can use these APIs to push data into a Power BI dataset, refresh a dataset, create or clone reports and dashboards, and much more. This allows for a programmatic interaction with Power BI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | finished_successfully | aaa20667-7415-4ce7-9e6e-2e00afedccb3 |

If you want to create a custom API, you might want to look into using a back-end framework like Express.js (for Node.js), Django (for Python), or Rails (for Ruby). These tools provide more direct support for creating APIs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It's easy to get started with and it's great for creating small to medium-sized web applications, such as APIs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | finished_successfully | aaa2d08a-90a4-4c6d-b914-6bc1cac5cb95 |

You could also consider using Flask-RESTful, which is an extension for Flask that adds support for quickly building REST APIs, or Flask-RESTPlus, which comes with Swagger documentation built in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

If you want to get a list of all tables and columns in Athena, you would need to query the `information_schema.columns` table, which holds metadata about all tables and columns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | finished_successfully | 83d692ac-ac14-441a-9e64-5aa4c72d025f |

The job_info subquery is used to get job information, and then it is joined with the sysjobsteps table to get the details for each step of the job.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | finished_successfully | aaa28fcf-f747-4019-886a-f9563f121c1b |

The script part `Qualify *;` and `Unqualify;` are usually used when you want to fully qualify all field names in all subsequent tables loaded or joined in the script by prefixing each field name with the name of the table. In your case, it is not necessary as you are loading data from a single table source.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                       |                                      |

The `step_id = 0` represents the job outcome itself (success or failure), but not all jobs may have an entry with `step_id = 0` if they have not yet been run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | finished_successfully | aaa2fbe0-4eef-435d-8d34-46f7eeae95f5 |

However, you could try using the `STATS_DATE()` function which returns the date of the most recent update for statistics on a table or indexed view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

Row count: It's quite resource-intensive to get the exact row count for all tables and views, because it would involve running `SELECT COUNT(*)` against every table and view, which can be a slow operation on large tables. However, it's possible to get an approximation from the system catalog view `sys.dm_db_partition_stats`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

For the last update time, there's no direct way to get this information from SQL Server, as it doesn't natively track this metadata. However, you can get the last access and modification time of the underlying MDF and LDF files from the file system but it won't be very accurate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

Please be aware that the row count will only return for tables (where `o.type = 'U'`) as it doesn't make sense for procedures or views. Also, you'll need necessary permissions to access the MSDB database to retrieve job names.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

This sort of auditing is typically handled by custom application logic, such as triggers or extra logging tables, rather than being a built-in feature of the database system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | finished_successfully | aaa28138-5056-493f-a3a0-074b199f8d5e |

This might involve creating triggers on the tables you want to audit that fire when an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operation occurs. These triggers could then insert a row into an audit table that includes the current user, the time of the operation, and the type of operation. For tracking object creation, you might need to create DDL triggers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

However, due to security reasons, SQL Server does not provide a way to directly determine if a user has a password or uses Windows Authentication. It also does not inherently track user history. For that, you'd need an auditing mechanism in place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | finished_successfully | aaa2aa4f-63ff-4800-a866-099bdf00cc80 |

However, you could potentially infer this: generally, SQL Server logins (as opposed to Windows logins) have a password, while Windows logins do not because they use the Windows account's password.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                       |                                      |

You would need to set up some form of auditing to track this information. This could be using SQL Server's built-in SQL Server Audit feature, or potentially a third-party tool. If you need this information, I would recommend looking into these options.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                       |                                      |

Note that `permission_name = 'SELECT'` will retrieve users who have SELECT permissions on a schema. If you want other permissions like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, EXECUTE etc., then you need to adjust the condition accordingly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |

In the SQL Server, aliases created in the SELECT clause cannot be used elsewhere in the same query. Also, we have ambiguity in the column names 'last_run_date' and 'last_run_time'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | finished_successfully | aaa28b92-ce1b-440e-b69b-ac568530da91 |

In the context of SQL Server, you cannot use an alias of a column in the FROM clause directly.

While it doesn't hide the sheets per se, the sheets will appear empty to users who don't have access to the data that the sheet is designed to display. You need to be careful with section access because if not properly implemented, you might accidentally deny access to all the users, including yourself. Here is a simplified example of how you might implement this:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

Now, the situation seems to have become more challenging, with two leaders assigning me different tasks. I have no issues with handling diverse tasks, but it would be much more manageable if I knew my exact responsibilities and who my direct supervisor is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |
