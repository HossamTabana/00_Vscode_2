Libraries like `pytube` rely on matching patterns in the YouTube page's source to extract the necessary information, so when YouTube changes its structure, these patterns may no longer match, leading to the mentioned error. | finished_successfully | aaa25eed-8f0c-4d16-9c44-ba84612dd8d3 |

The highest resolutions like 1080p and above usually don't come with audio when fetched using the `filter(progressive=True)` method. Therefore, you'll have to combine video and audio manually to get the desired result.                                                                                        | finished_successfully | aaa2d9ee-d721-42bd-9b25-e8a875fa84e5 |

Directly executing scripts fetched from a database can introduce vulnerabilities. Ensure that you trust the scripts that are stored in your database, and that they can't be manipulated by malicious actors.                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

If you're seeing this error after fetching the script and trying to execute it, the most likely scenario is that there's some corruption in the way the script content is fetched or there might be a minor oversight in the process.                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

When you fetch it back and execute the script, it might not behave as expected.                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

After fetching, you don't need to revert them:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |

I can see that when you uploaded the script to the SQL database, all single quotes (`'`) have been replaced with double single quotes (`''`). This is a common technique in SQL to escape single quotes, but when you fetch the script back and try to execute it, it will throw syntax errors.                                                                                                                | finished_successfully | aaa208d1-8ce0-4f7f-a780-98fb751e195f |

Always be cautious when constructing SQL queries with embedded strings to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. Using parameterized queries is a more secure and recommended approach.                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

Make sure the function exists in the context you're working in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                       |                                      |

This way, when you import your script in other places, you won't unintentionally execute any code outside of functions. The `main` function at the end will return the DataFrame.                                                                                                                                                                                     | finished_successfully | aaa22271-b543-4eae-9318-83c65fb659d3 |

From the scripts you've shown, you're using `pymssql`, but there might be others you need.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                       |                                      |

Ensure you **never** package and distribute such information. Consider using environment variables, configuration files, or other methods to provide these values securely.                                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

This allows for relative `.env` paths.                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

The setting `"python.envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env"` in the `settings.json` file is a general setting for VSCode's Python extension, and it works with the current directory of the active Python file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | finished_successfully | 3f8d7169-4d88-434e-b8c6-8194b60c3fc4 |

The placeholder `${workspaceFolder}` refers to the root of the currently opened folder in VSCode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

When you open a Python file from a particular project (e.g., from `project1`), the context switches to that folder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

Therefore, `${workspaceFolder}` dynamically adjusts based on the currently active Python file's location.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

The Python extension then looks for an `.env` file in that location and loads it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

You could either load both `.env` files and ensure the correct order of loading, or avoid having overlapping variable names.                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |

Ensure proper documentation so that future maintenance is straightforward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

If your `general.env` contains such data, add it to `.gitignore`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

Ensure the `.env` files are correctly located in the project directories and the `general.env` at the workspace root.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

As always, add `.env` and `general.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent committing sensitive information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

If a new project uses shared credentials, it will automatically use `general.env`. If it needs unique credentials, just add a new `.env` within its folder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                       |                                      |

So the column name 'language' and 'LANGUAGE' are treated differently. It could be that your actual column name is in a different case than you've used in your code.                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

The specifics of this step will depend on how QlikSense integrates with Snowflake. Typically, QlikSense will use a combination of Snowflake's SQL commands and its native functionalities to push data.                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

The sequence part is commented out as `sys.sequences` is not a recognized system view in SQL Server (as of my last update in 2021). If you're working with another DBMS that has sequences and a corresponding system view, you might need to adjust the query accordingly.                                     |                       |                                      |

Let me help you with that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | finished_successfully | aaa2d6d6-0833-4d10-a7f8-23695e732aa5 |

Let's correct that:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | finished_successfully | aaa29319-85b5-48e7-b40b-f61aa5abd0bf |
