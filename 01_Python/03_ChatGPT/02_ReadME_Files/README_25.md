Parquet supports schema evolution, i.e., the schema can change over time. If your Parquet files were written with a different schema (for instance, 'ID_NUMBER' was initially an integer and later changed to long), you could face such issues.

The IntegerType in Spark can handle 32-bit signed integer values while LongType can handle 64-bit signed integer values. So the data in your parquet file might be larger than what can fit into an IntegerType, and that's why you're getting an error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

You can do this manually by using the UI or you can use dbutils.fs to load files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

Unfortunately, PySpark doesn't support reading Excel files directly, but you can convert the Excel file to CSV first and then read it using PySpark.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |

This depends on where you've stored it - it could be in a database, a text file, or even just a string in your code. For the purposes of this guide, let's assume you have it as a string in your code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |

The error might be occurring due to a specific data type or value that is not being handled correctly by the Parquet writer. Reviewing the schema of the problematic tables might help identify a potential issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

Another thing to consider is that parquet format has limitations on column names. For example, if the column names have special characters, it may cause issues. Here's how to handle these cases:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

For instance, when you use `coalesce(1)`, it may not always create a single parquet file due to the nature of how the parquet format works. If you absolutely need a single file, consider writing the dataframe to a single file in a temporary location and then moving the file to the final location.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |

Assuming the table is stored in a database, you can use the appropriate API or query to read the table into a DataFrame. Here's an example using the PySpark API:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |

Perform data processing: Once the table data is loaded into the DataFrame, you can apply various data processing operations depending on your requirements. This could include filtering rows, transforming columns, aggregating data, joining with other tables, and more. You can use DataFrame APIs or Spark SQL to perform these operations. Here's an example:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

Filter the latest data: Join the original DataFrame with the latest_timestamp_df to filter out the rows with timestamps that are not equal to the maximum timestamp for each ID. This will give you the latest values for each ID. Here's an example:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

Incremental loading: To perform incremental loading every day, you need to load only the new data that has been added since the last load. You can keep track of the maximum timestamp from the previous load and load the data with a timestamp greater than that value. Here's an example:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

Modify the notebook for scheduled execution: To enable automatic execution, modify the notebook to read the latest data, perform data processing, and save the result to the S3 bucket. For incremental loading, you can include the code mentioned earlier to filter and save only the new data. Make sure to specify the output path in the S3 bucket.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                       |                                      |

Convert the column to a different data type: If possible, convert the problematic integer column to a different data type that is supported by Parquet (e.g., string, long). You can perform the conversion before saving the DataFrame to Parquet format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

You can do this by setting the `parquet.enable.dictionary` property to `false` when saving the DataFrame to Parquet.

Update the Parquet library version: If you are using an older version of the Parquet library, consider updating to a newer version. Newer versions often include bug fixes and improvements that could address the unsupported dictionary encoding issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

It seems that the error you're encountering is related to Parquet dictionary encoding, even though you mentioned you are working with a CSV file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | finished_successfully | aaa20b6f-dee5-4b42-bdd8-1063468e74d8 |

It seems that there are some underlying complications that are causing the error even though we are explicitly using the CSV format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | finished_successfully | aaa2ff08-9160-4086-bae5-a70d235d391f |

If you are still encountering errors related to Parquet, we can try an alternative approach by writing the DataFrame to a temporary local file and then uploading it to S3. Here's an updated version of the code using this approach:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | in_progress           | aaa287ec-5541-453d-a7bf-1e9061cde1bb |

Then, it maps each row of the RDD to a string representation, joining the values with commas to mimic the CSV format. The resulting RDD is then saved as a text file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

In Python, indentation is significant and it's used to denote blocks of code like loops or if statements. However, SQL doesn't use indentation for the same purpose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | finished_successfully | aaa28ebc-bd96-4681-b188-c3e367ad3a46 |

For Python string literals, you need to enclose them with quotation marks. For multiline strings, you can use triple quotes (either `"""` or `'''`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | finished_successfully | aaa215d7-7166-4e94-8691-846eb92049c3 |

This is because the `try` function is specific to Presto and Trino SQL dialects. In these dialects, `try` is used to handle exceptions in SQL expressions, but it's not a part of standard SQL and hence is not recognized in all SQL environments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | finished_successfully | aaa29094-4066-46fc-9ca8-23348628cbc7 |

Therefore, it is not available in a Databricks notebook if you're running Spark SQL queries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |

For instance, if you're trying to avoid errors from division by zero, you could use a `CASE` statement to check if the denominator is zero before performing the division:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |
