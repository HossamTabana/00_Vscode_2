This can be useful, for example, when you want to remove the time part of a timestamp and only work with the date part. Add the following line to your script:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

The new fields `FormattedOrderDate`, `OrderDateNum`, and `OrderDateFloor` will now be available in your data model. You can use these fields in your charts and tables to analyze the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                       |                                      |

Next, create a calendar table containing all the dates between the minimum and maximum dates of both Port Load Date and Port Discharge Date. You can achieve this using a loop in the script:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

It iterates through the files in the source folder, checks if the file has the desired extension (in this case, `.qvd`), and copies the file to the destination folder. The function is then called with the appropriate arguments to copy all QVD files from `src_folder` to `dst_folder`.                                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

The formula first uses the `REGEX_Replace` function to extract the last word (the part after the last space) from the text. Then, it calculates the length of the original text and subtracts the length of the last word plus 1 (to remove the space before the last word) to determine the number of characters to keep from the original text. Finally, it uses the `Left` function to keep the specified number of characters from the original text.                                                               |                       |                                      |

In that case, you can adjust the formula to use a regular expression to capture the last two words and their preceding spaces. You can use the following adjusted formula in Alteryx:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | finished_successfully | aaa2af67-6766-415e-828a-19153528c582 |

The `REGEX_Replace()` function captures the last two words and their preceding spaces using the pattern `^.*?(\s+\S+\s+\S+)$`. The pattern `^.*?` matches any characters (lazy) from the beginning of the string, and `(\s+\S+\s+\S+)$` captures the last two words and their preceding spaces, where `\s+` matches one or more whitespace characters and `\S+` matches one or more non-whitespace characters.                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

Then, the `Length()` function calculates the length of the captured last two words and their preceding spaces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

Finally, the `Left()` function extracts the substring from the original text up to the desired position, which is the length of the original text minus the length of the captured last two words and their preceding spaces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

Assuming the data is in a single column named 'route' in a table called 'routes_table', you can use the following query:                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | finished_successfully | aaa26b94-d972-4039-9a4a-8c4e263d8f41 |

Assuming your table is named `my_table` and the column with the routing information is named `route`, you can use a query like this:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | finished_successfully | aaa2607d-b5a2-4cbe-bb5b-972d15f8cb20 |

You can use the REGEXP_EXTRACT function in Amazon Athena to accomplish this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | finished_successfully | aaa2959b-e0c0-4aee-b223-b7ebbfadecb2 |

It seems that Athena does not support referencing columns that are created within the same SELECT clause. To fix this, we can use nested subqueries to extract the AL2 and RA substrings, and then extract the POA and POD values. Here's the updated query:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | finished_successfully | aaa212ca-91ba-493b-ad59-5565aa8aaa21 |

The last element of this new split (using `-1` as the index) should be the POA and POD, respectively. The REGEXP_REPLACE function is then used to remove any non-alphabetic characters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

In the `WITH` clause, you can replace the sample data with your actual table by changing `sample_data` to your table name and removing the `WITH` clause.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

Unfortunately, it seems that Athena doesn't support negative indices in the SPLIT_PART function. We can work around this by using a combination of ARRAY and LENGTH functions:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | finished_successfully | aaa26aea-6760-4683-8168-6c8ec9fe4c72 |

REGEXP_REPLACE is then used to remove any non-alphabetic characters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

Then, REGEXP_REPLACE is used to remove the `(AL2)` and `(RA)` substrings. The WHERE clause ensures that we only process rows with exactly one `(AL2)` and one `(RA)` substring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

However, developers and companies might have created applications that utilize the OpenAI API to integrate ChatGPT into their apps since then. It is possible that there are third-party applications that feature ChatGPT on the Apple App Store. To find any such applications, search for "ChatGPT" or "GPT" in the App Store search bar and explore the results. Be sure to check the credibility and reviews of any third-party applications before installing them. | finished_successfully | aaa2eb6e-e238-4350-b4b2-f0a64cf02f35 |

Avoid high heels and cleats: High heels, cleats, and other hard-soled shoes can cause dents and scratches in your parquet floor. Encourage household members and guests to remove their shoes when entering your home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

Maintain a consistent indoor humidity level between 40-60% to minimize the risk of the wood expanding or contracting, which can lead to scratches and other damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |

If you notice any scratches, address them promptly by gently buffing the area with a fine steel wool pad, followed by applying a compatible wood finish.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                       |                                      |

Sweep or vacuum the floor thoroughly, and use a slightly damp microfiber mop or cloth to clean the surface. Make sure to use a cleaner specifically designed for parquet floors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                       |                                      |

It's important to choose a product specifically designed for wood flooring, as other polishes might not provide adequate protection or may damage the floor's finish.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

This will help you confirm that the polish is compatible with your floor and won't cause discoloration or other issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                       |                                      |

Apply the polish: Following the manufacturer's instructions, apply the polish evenly to your parquet floor using a microfiber mop, sponge, or cloth. Start at one corner of the room and work your way towards the exit, working in small sections. Make sure to apply the polish in the direction of the wood grain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                       |                                      |

Allow the polish to dry: After applying the polish, give it ample time to dry according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The drying time can vary depending on the type of polish and environmental conditions, but it's generally between 30 minutes to a few hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |

Solid hardwood floors consist of a single piece of wood, while engineered wood floors have a top layer of hardwood veneer over layers of plywood or other materials. Laminate parquet floors have a photographic image of wood on a high-density fiberboard (HDF) core with a protective top layer.                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

Observe the pattern: Parquet floors come in various patterns, such as herringbone, chevron, basketweave, and Versailles. These patterns can help you identify the type of parquet flooring you have. Herringbone is the most common parquet pattern, consisting of rectangular wood pieces arranged in a zigzag pattern.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

Installation method: Parquet floors can be installed using different methods, such as glue-down, nail-down, or floating. Glue-down floors use adhesive to secure the parquet pieces to the subfloor, while nail-down floors are secured using nails or staples. Floating floors are not attached to the subfloor but are instead connected to each other via a click-lock system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

Finished floors have a protective layer, such as polyurethane or wax, applied to the surface, while unfinished floors do not. If your floor has a glossy or matte sheen and appears to have a protective coating, it is likely a finished floor. Unfinished floors may appear dull and are more susceptible to stains and damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                       |                                      |
