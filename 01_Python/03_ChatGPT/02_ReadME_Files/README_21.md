If the data you're trying to send already exists in the table, the API might refuse to insert it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

Be careful to choose an account that has the minimum necessary permissions for the service to function, to reduce potential security risks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

Make sure that the SQL Server Agent service account or proxy has read and execute permissions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                       |                                      |

Make sure that the SQL Server Agent service is running under an account that has sufficient privileges to access the batch file.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

If you have already created a proxy account, double-check that it's configured correctly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

Try disabling UAC on the SQL Server and see if that resolves the issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                       |                                      |

Right-click on the failing job and select "View History". Look for the details of the failure, specifically for "Calling_CMD" which is the failing step. The details might give you more information about the failure.                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

Try running the batch script manually to see if it runs successfully. You may need to run it as the `t_board_db` user if that's the user running the job in SQL Server.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

However, there are a few things to consider when you're trying to execute this batch file from a SQL Server Agent job from a different server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | finished_successfully | aaa26b1d-cc65-4a9d-92f3-7701dbbc4fb7 |

Your batch file includes both relative paths (like `%~dp0\log\`) and a local call to a tool (`BoardProcedureLauncher.exe` on the local drive). This could be a problem if the batch file is being run on `KFICWPNXAPDB01` instead of `KFICWPNXAPPP01`. Ensure that the SQL Server Job is correctly set up to run the batch file on `KFICWPNXAPPP01`. |                       |                                      |

If you're running this batch file from a different location (like from `KFICWPNXAPDB01`), then `%~dp0` might not resolve to the path you're expecting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

It does not wait for the job to finish, and it does not return the job's outcome. If you need to wait for the job to finish and perhaps capture the result, you would need to devise a polling mechanism or some other means to track the job's status.                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

The procedure is then called with `EXEC @return_value = [dbo].[zz_TestExecuteSQLJob]`, which executes the procedure and assigns the return value to `@return_value`. The `SELECT 'Return Value' = @return_value` statement then selects this value so you can see it.                                                                                                                                         |                       |                                      |

In this case, you'll need to normalize the data using `pd.json_normalize()`. However, if `pd.json_normalize()` is not working as expected, it might be due to the depth of nesting in your data.                                                                                                                | finished_successfully | aaa21a58-54a6-41cc-a284-fc94bd2e3f1e |

Since you want to make a GET request to the `api_url` with the `headers`, the correct line would be `auth_response = requests.get(api_url, headers=headers)`.                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

The GET method is used to retrieve data, and any necessary parameters are usually included in the URL itself or as URL parameters, not in the request body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

I've assumed that the status of your session is contained in a `status` key in the data returned by your GET request. You may need to replace `'status'` with the actual key used by your API.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                       |                                      |

The `time` module provides various time-related functions, one of which is `time.sleep()`. This function pauses the execution of the program for a specified amount of time.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | finished_successfully | aaa22f1f-2f6b-40d4-af00-657df8537a0f |

We'll need to join the `tt1120` table to the `tt1970` table twice: once for the "First ID" and once for the "Second ID". Here is an example of how you could write the SQL query:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | finished_successfully | aaa21e46-16dc-4c12-9682-9f57b5bbee61 |

Suppose you have a table named `employee` with the following columns: `id`, `name`, `department`, and `salary`. You want to classify these employees into salary brackets like 'low', 'medium', and 'high'. You could write something like this:                                                                                                                                                    | finished_successfully | aaa25620-2d55-4eb6-a97d-19174f645c4f |

So, once a condition is true, it will stop reading and return the result. If no conditions are true, it will return the value in the `ELSE` clause. If there is no `ELSE` part and no conditions are true, it will return NULL.                                                                                                                                                  |                       |                                      |

However, there are some optimizations and enhancements we can make to improve readability, maintainability, and potentially performance. Here's an improved version of your query:                                                                                                                          | finished_successfully | aaa2abbd-fe52-4c3b-83dc-d122a39d24d5 |

You already have the right structure but by moving the subqueries to the top using WITH, it would be easier to follow the logic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

Using meaningful aliases: I changed your aliases (a,b,c,d,e,f,h1,h2,h3, etc.) to more meaningful names related to the table they refer to (tt1320_filtered, tt1190_filtered, etc.). This can make it easier for others (or yourself in the future) to understand your query.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

Using specific columns in SELECT clause: Instead of using "Select *" in subqueries, I recommend specifying column names which you need. This can improve performance, especially when the tables have many columns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

Removing redundant CAST operations: If a column is already in a certain datatype, it's not necessary to cast it to the same datatype again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

Removing coalesce function in the join condition of the final select: It is not recommended to use functions in the join condition.
