However, AWS Athena does not directly provide a function to get table metadata. But you can use AWS Glue, which is fully integrated with Athena. Here's an example of how you can do this:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | finished_successfully | aaa2b2e8-7f64-41c8-ac11-faf30c81f8b3 |

The function I provided earlier will return `None` if the state of the query execution is not 'SUCCEEDED'.

This allows you to exclude certain columns.

Instead, you should use the `YEAR` function. The corrected query would look something like this:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | finished_successfully | aaa2e0b1-8915-4fba-8473-53bca99dee67 |

PyPI is intended to be a public repository where people can easily share and install Python packages. If a package is uploaded to PyPI, anyone can install it using pip without needing to enter a password.                                                                                                                                               | finished_successfully | 85af5a77-1ec9-4d85-a77d-cfc2c38b79ff |

Users can then install the packages directly from the repository using pip, provided they have access to the repository. For instance, pip allows installing packages from a git repository with the following command: `pip install git+https://github.com/username/reponame.git`.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

Once you've created a Docker image, you can upload it to a Docker registry, such as Docker Hub or a private registry. From there, anyone who has access can pull and run the Docker image on their own machine, as long as they have Docker installed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | finished_successfully | 983cd6e3-63b1-4559-9659-cde07c2c6193 |

The installation steps vary depending on your operating system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                       |                                      |

It specifies the base image and the steps to install your package and its dependencies. Here's an example Dockerfile for a Python application:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                       |                                      |

If you use Docker Hub, you can do this using the `docker push` command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |

GitLab has a built-in feature called GitLab Package Registry that allows you to host multiple package types, including PyPI (Python) packages. Here's how you could use this feature:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | finished_successfully | 3560dcb2-ff90-425f-be78-ad693fff56ed |

This typically includes a `setup.py` file, which is the build script for setuptools. It tells setuptools about your package (such as the name and version) and the files to include.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

If the pipeline is successful, your package will be uploaded to the GitLab Package Registry. You can view your packages by navigating to your project in GitLab and then going to "Packages & Registries" > "Package Registry".                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

This file should look something like this:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

However, it's important to note that a key concern when sharing code containing sensitive information like server details, database names, user names, and passwords, is security. To ensure security and keep sensitive details confidential, these should be stored in environment variables or encrypted files and not directly within your codebase.                                                                                                                                                 | finished_successfully | 7ad7ca73-2a30-405b-b713-5bb3c5f56493 |

However, you could store this script in a private GitLab repository and provide instructions for others to clone the repository, install necessary dependencies, and run the script on their own machine.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

These should be placed in a separate configuration file or stored as environment variables on the machine where the script is going to be run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                       |                                      |

However, as your script relies heavily on database connections and fetches a local user ID, it presents challenges when trying to package it as a library.                                                                                                                                                                                      | finished_successfully | 2193ede6-9cfe-4331-9c3e-562c6d500ba4 |

This means that if a user knows where to look, they can indeed open and inspect the code of these scripts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | finished_successfully | 0b3ad928-130c-4c7f-836e-60260e183fbc |

If you need to distribute a package that interacts with sensitive data, consider using environment variables or some kind of secure configuration files that the end user can set up on their own system, without the sensitive information ever being included in the package itself.                                                                                                                                                 |                       |                                      |

The typical usage of Python packages involves sharing the source code, which means that the end users have access to the package code, including all the scripts and modules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | finished_successfully | 829ef9c8-2f0e-42b3-8bfe-f1a80cb691bd |

The code within Python packages is usually easily accessible. While you can use obfuscation or compile Python to bytecode (*.pyc files), this doesn't fully secure your code. Anyone determined could still reverse engineer it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |

This would completely hide your code and allow control over who has access based on API keys. However, the data would then be transferred over the internet, which might not be ideal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

This executable can then be run without revealing the underlying code. However, this doesn't integrate as smoothly with Python's pip/environment workflow, and isn't as easy to use for users who want to use your function as part of their own Python scripts.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

This is a complex problem that involves trade-offs between code security, ease of use, and data security. A proper solution may involve changes to your program design, such as removing the need for sensitive data to be stored within the script, or using an external service to handle the sensitive parts of the process. If this project is important for your business, you might want to consider consulting with a software development firm or a professional with experience in Python application design and security. |                       |                                      |

However, it's important to note that anyone who has access to the repository would still be able to see the source code. Here's a brief overview:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | finished_successfully | 35ec90cb-3861-4b22-a0f1-ed2b76055c4f |

However, those who have access to the repository would still be able to see the source code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

You can control who has access to install the package, but the installed package still contains readable source code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

But this doesn't help in hiding the source code from users who are running the code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

Even if you could compile or obfuscate Python code, it isn't a foolproof way of protecting the source code or sensitive data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

You may need to consider setting up a secure server that can access the sensitive data and perform the sensitive operations, and then let your Python code interact with this server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

Advanced users or malicious actors can still potentially reverse-engineer an executable to gain insight into its original code or behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | finished_successfully | 2247ce9f-976e-48bf-9d90-508ea5ef1a93 |

This is because, unlike a Python package, they can't import your functions and return values from an executable file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | finished_successfully | ce1d42a9-35ca-41fe-98d2-9b7cd907b821 |

Power BI runs the Python script in a separate process and gets the results, which enables using any Python libraries and functions. Here's a simplified process:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | finished_successfully | 86a021c4-bdea-4901-ac1d-ca3848c06d39 |

Power BI primarily works with structured data sources like databases, web APIs, and file formats like CSV, Excel, and JSON.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | finished_successfully | 3ef41012-c87c-4eea-a079-a1b8ec660590 |

However, running a standalone executable file (like a .exe file) and retrieving data from it is not something that Power BI is designed to do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

This is, however, a workaround and not a straightforward way to use data in Power BI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                       |                                      |

If you want to call different procedures, you would need to adjust the `Query_url` accordingly when you are inserting into `sta.PowerBI_Calls`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

The SELECT statement for the `sta.PowerBI_Users` table now checks both the `User_ID` and `Region_Name`. If the user is not found or their daily calls have been exceeded, a dataframe `df_error` is created and assigned the error message. If the user has not exceeded their daily call limit, the procedure is executed, the results are assigned to dataframe `df`, and the call is logged in the `sta.PowerBI_Calls` table.                                                                              |                       |                                      |

If you want to return these dataframes from a function or use them outside this scope, you will need to declare them earlier in your code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |

It's always best to use environment variables or separate configuration files to handle such sensitive information, and these files should not be included in the public repository or package.                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

It allows others to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software. To use the MIT license, you would create a file named `LICENSE` (no file extension) in your project's root directory with the following text:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

Always use environment variables or separate configuration files to handle such sensitive information, and these files should not be included in the public repository or package.                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |
