You're looking for a way to use the `OFFSET` function in Excel to reference cells based on the current month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | finished_successfully | 865381d6-e42c-4d4d-900d-2807854dd7b9 |

The `MONTH(TODAY())` function returns the current month as a number (1 for January, 2 for February, etc.), and we subtract by the necessary offset to get the month you want.

Second, we'll use SQLAlchemy, a SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python, to interact with your SQL database.

We then get the source code of this function using the `inspect` module's `getsource()` function. We replace single quotes in the source code with double quotes to escape them for the SQL insert query. Finally, we insert the source code into a SQL table named `python_scripts` using SQLAlchemy's `text()` function to construct the SQL query.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

We then unescape the source code by replacing double quotes with single quotes. We use Python's `exec()` function to execute this script. Finally, we call the `main()` function defined in the script to get the data as a DataFrame.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

This way, the variables will be accessible throughout the entire class or function, including in any inner functions. Here's a version of your script where everything is encapsulated in a main function:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | finished_successfully | 72942181-e5cd-437e-af09-5680451de2a2 |

This will also help in ensuring that variables are contained within the function scope:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | finished_successfully | fce46d11-4978-4668-8bbf-db24c1281757 |

Finally, you'll need a separate script to retrieve this code from the SQL table and execute it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

If you only need a simple virtual environment without any additional features, venv is a good choice. The right tool to use depends on your specific needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                       |                                      |

This behavior was chosen for cleanliness and because it reduces the chance of accidentally including the virtual environment in source control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | finished_successfully | aaa2d346-8a56-4b4d-835f-10890c0e9892 |

Whenever you run commands using `poetry run`, Poetry automatically uses the virtual environment. For example:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | finished_successfully | aaa2a065-0300-459c-8d92-a6be3ee10967 |

Poetry isn't concerned with individual Python files in your project; instead, it handles the project's dependencies and manages the virtual environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | finished_successfully | aaa2d97c-2f86-4fa7-bae6-4c02721ce3c0 |

You typically update it by adding or removing dependencies with the `poetry add` and `poetry remove` commands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | finished_successfully | aaa28112-93ae-406c-8ad4-5bc3e162169c |

You'll use the `poetry build` command, which builds your project into distributable formats - a source archive (tar.gz) and a wheel (.whl), which can then be installed via pip.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | finished_successfully | aaa27eb7-c787-40d8-bcf7-e4c72ee32852 |

However, if the column contains non-numeric characters, you'll first need to remove or replace these. Here's an example:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | finished_successfully | aaa21104-7296-4a8f-a199-9fa8f1d76f10 |

SSMS provides a 'Find' functionality (Ctrl+F) that you can use to search through code in the currently open window, but it doesn't provide a built-in way to search through all objects in a database. For that, you may need to write a script or use a third-party tool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |
