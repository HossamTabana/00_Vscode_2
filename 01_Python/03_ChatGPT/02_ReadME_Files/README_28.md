Unfortunately, you cannot directly move a file to a different folder using the GitLab web interface. However, you can perform the move in two steps by creating a new file in the desired folder and then deleting the old file.                                                                                                                                                                | finished_successfully | aaa20b7b-e775-471c-8ac7-4a9c4ad7b1da |

This delay is in place to prevent accidental deletions and to give users a brief window to recover the group if the deletion was unintentional.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | finished_successfully | aaa2ca6b-d9c8-4ea4-9ba6-bc9bef5d2f13 |

To update the progress percentage of an Epic, you will need to mark its related issues as completed or adjust their weights.                                                                                                                                                                                          | finished_successfully | aaa24eb6-f431-4fde-b7f9-10741452986e |

Connect a 'Browse' tool to the 'Formula' tool and run the workflow again to see the results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

Instead, you can use the combination of DateTimeFormat and DateTimeParse functions to achieve the desired result. Here's the revised approach:                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | finished_successfully | aaa2f99d-1688-40fb-9ac3-671b13b888bf |

If you want to ignore any middle updates and only consider the minimum arrival date when UniqueValue is at its minimum and the maximum arrival date when UniqueValue is at its maximum, you can modify the steps as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | finished_successfully | aaa2945f-2ebf-4f7a-8024-db720817b434 |

Run the workflow, and the Summarize tool will provide you with the minimum arrival date for each UniqueValue and the maximum arrival date when UniqueValue is at its maximum. The middle updates will be ignored.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |

You're right that Alteryx's Summarize tool doesn't directly support creating new columns within the tool itself. However, you can achieve the desired result by using additional tools in Alteryx. Here's an updated approach:                                                                                                                                                                                                       | finished_successfully | aaa27ab3-7fd2-4033-aa92-eeed9d550344 |

The lexicographic order of the ISO 8601 timestamp format should sort them correctly as long as they all have the same format:                                                                                                                                                                                    | finished_successfully | aaa22258-56ce-44a4-be7f-9a0a3889cfe5 |

It's possible that the timestamp strings in your 'curr_timestamp' column may have different formats or varying levels of precision, causing the lexicographic sorting to not work as expected. In this case, you can try to cast the strings to timestamps and then sort by the converted values.                                                                                                                                                | finished_successfully | aaa2779d-29dc-4f0d-bf8c-90a9f251073b |

If your strings use a different format, please let me know, and I can provide a modified solution.                                                                                      |                       |                                      |

You can use the `parse_datetime` function to convert a string to a timestamp.

In general, FM radios in Europe work on a frequency range of 87.5 to 108 MHz, while AM radios work on a range of 531 to 1602 kHz. These ranges should typically cover Egyptian radio stations as well, but it's always good to double-check the specific frequencies of the stations you want to listen to.                                                              |                       |                                      |

| 2758 | d1830147-9fa3-453e-aa9a-cb41caace853 | assistant     |   1.68337e+09 | I apologize for the confusion. It appears that the `ARRAY_ORDINALITY` function is not available in Athena. Instead, you can use a workaround to achieve the same result using `CARDINALITY` function with `REGEXP_EXTRACT_ALL`.

In this case, you can use the `ARRAY_JOIN` function along with `ARRAY_AGG` to achieve the desired result.

This function allows you to extract a substring that matches a specific regular expression pattern. In this case, you can use the `^.{0,5}(?= - VE)` pattern to extract the first 5 characters before the first "VE" in the Routing column.

It seems the previous regular expression pattern didn't account for situations like the one you mentioned. Let's update the query with a new regular expression pattern `(?<= - )[A-Z]{5}(?= - VE)` to extract the 5-letter code that appears immediately before the first "VE":                                                                                                                                                               | finished_successfully | aaa23113-2952-4237-8ed4-bccfb568403a |

I made an assumption in the previous regular expression pattern that there would always be a space and a hyphen before the 5-letter code. To handle cases where the 5-letter code is at the beginning of the Routing string, you can use the updated regular expression pattern `(^|[A-Z]{5})(?= - VE)`:                                                                                                                                         | finished_successfully | aaa2d7b2-6369-4d95-848e-cffb8b8431cc |

To handle cases like this, we'll use the regular expression pattern `(?<= - )[A-Z]{5}(?= - VE(?!.* - VE))|(?<= - )[A-Z]{5}(?= - [A-Z]{2}(?!.* - VE))` to extract the 5-letter code that appears immediately before the last "VE" or any 2-letter code that follows the last "VE" in the Routing string:                             | finished_successfully | aaa2ae10-8cfe-4579-aa08-ba0873c36ea5 |

You can remove it and use the `REGEXP_EXTRACT` function directly on the result of the `array_join()` function.

Sort: Next, add a Sort tool to sort the data based on the "location name," "DP Voyage," and "event time stamp" fields. To do this, connect the Sort tool to the Input Data tool, and then configure the Sort tool by dragging the "location name" and "DP Voyage" fields into the first and second sorting priority respectively, and set both to "Ascending." Then, drag the "event time stamp" field into the third sorting priority, and set it to "Ascending" as well. |                       |                                      |

Configure the Summarize tool by dragging the "location name" and "DP Voyage" fields into the Group By section. Then, drag the "event time stamp" field into the Numeric section, and select "Min" as the aggregation method. This will give you the minimum "event time stamp" for each unique combination of "location name" and "DP Voyage."                                       |                       |                                      |

Configure the Summarize tool by dragging the "DP Voyage" field into the Group By section. Then, drag the "event time stamp" field into the Numeric section, and select "Min" as the aggregation method. This will give you the minimum "event time stamp" for each unique "DP Voyage."                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

Join: Add a Join tool to the workflow and connect its left input (L) to the Summarize tool and its right input (R) to the Input Data tool. Configure the Join tool by setting the key field for both inputs to "DP Voyage" and "event time stamp." This will join the original dataset with the minimum "event time stamp" dataset based on the DP Voyage and event time stamp, thus giving you the minimum time stamp for each DP Voyage with the corresponding location. |                       |                                      |

Then subtract the two numerical values to get the delta in days. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this in the QlikView script:                                                                                                                                           | finished_successfully | aaa2c10f-6ea9-4861-a469-52ed80f60bd5 |

For this example, let's assume your data has fields `StartDate` and `EndDate`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

The general syntax is `Date#(text, format)`. You need to specify the format of your date fields. For example, if your dates are in the format "YYYY-MM-DD", you can use the following script:                                                                                                                                                                                  |                       |                                      |

The new field `DeltaDays` will now be available in your data model, representing the difference in days between `StartDate` and `EndDate`. You can use this field in your charts and tables to analyze the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |
