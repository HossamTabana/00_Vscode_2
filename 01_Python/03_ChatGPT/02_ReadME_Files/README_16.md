Ensure that the correct Python runtime is selected, especially if you have multiple Python installations. You might have a more optimized Python environment that you use with VSCode/Jupyter, and you need to ensure that Power BI is using this same environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

If you're dealing with large amounts of data or complex calculations, it would be better to handle this outside of Power BI, perhaps by creating a dedicated data processing script or using a more appropriate data processing tool or platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

However, within Anaconda, you can have different environments and each environment could have different packages and Python versions installed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | finished_successfully | aaa2c7cf-be94-4711-a3db-5ab81d7044e8 |

You can do this by typing `conda activate myenv`, replacing `myenv` with the name of your environment. Then type `where python` (on Windows) or `which python` (on MacOS or Linux) to get the path of the Python interpreter for that environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

This can be checked using the `pip freeze` command in your Anaconda prompt after activating your environment. Differences in package versions can sometimes lead to differences in performance or unexpected behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

If you're using data files, make sure the path to those files is correct in the context of Power BI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

|      |                                      |               |               | Remember that the data size, hardware limitations, and script efficiency could still be the main reason behind the performance difference. Python in Power BI is not meant for heavy computation, so for data-intensive tasks, consider performing them outside Power BI and just bringing the results in for visualization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |

If these libraries are not installed, it might slow down the connection. Make sure to install necessary libraries in the Python environment used by Power BI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

To optimize this, you may want to make use of Python's concurrent.futures or asyncio library to make the HTTP requests concurrently.

The rest of the script remains the same, making concurrent HTTP requests to potentially speed up data fetching.

The issue is occurring because we are attempting to filter out None values from `results`, which is a generator of DataFrames, using the built-in `filter()` function. The `filter()` function, when used without a function as its first argument, attempts to evaluate the truthiness of each item in the iterable, which is causing the issue as DataFrames have ambiguous truth values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | finished_successfully | aaa25fac-8da4-4827-b3e0-fcffc2b5eea3 |

This is a generic "catch-all" error when the server throws an exception.

If you send too many requests at the same time, the server might respond with a 500 error. Try reducing the number of threads in the ThreadPoolExecutor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                       |                                      |

Perhaps it is not able to handle your requests for some reason, or maybe there is a bug in the server code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |

It seems the server is not able to handle too many concurrent connections, which is what ThreadPoolExecutor is doing by executing the function concurrently with 10 threads (i.e., 10 requests at the same time).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | finished_successfully | aaa2aa2a-adf1-48ef-b79f-93b0c94b2f92 |

This will execute the `fetch_data` function sequentially for each month-version pair, which should comply with the server's rate limits. Please note that this approach will be slower than using ThreadPoolExecutor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                       |                                      |

It's a generic error that's thrown when the server encounters an unexpected condition that prevents it from fulfilling the request. In your case, the Power BI environment is likely making an HTTP request to the server (in the `fetch_data` function), and the server is encountering an issue while processing this request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | finished_successfully | aaa2e354-3dee-48e4-a9cb-fe77c2bdc9bd |

If this is the case, the Python libraries (like `requests`) may not have been installed correctly in the environment that Power BI is using. You can specify the Python environment for Power BI in the settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                       |                                      |

You might need to check with your network administrator to see if this is the case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

This could be due to rate limits, concurrent connection limits, or other server-side issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

It might be worth reaching out to Power BI support or checking the server logs if you have access to them.

For this reason, I've added `ManualStatusHandling` option to handle HTTP errors manually. In this case, if any of these errors occur, a binary error value will be returned and no automatic retry will be performed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

This is because it would require you to effectively embed a browser window within PowerPoint that could display the report. PowerPoint and VBA do not directly support this functionality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | finished_successfully | aaa23dae-0b96-4ae7-91b3-0140cc409039 |

Then it will stop matching when it encounters a space (because of the non-greedy .*? part).

We need to add two new columns: 'REP CL Scheme' as float and 'Rules' as '0'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

The second part after UNION ALL requires filtering the DataFrame where 'CL Scheme' is either '0068_OR' or '0105_OR', then grouping by several columns and calculating the sum of 'REP CL Scheme', and finally adding the column 'Rules' with value '1'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

Finally, we concatenate the two dataframes obtained from step 1 and 2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                       |                                      |

This can be achieved using pandas, though the syntax is a bit different. Let's break it down:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | finished_successfully | aaa2098d-e752-4c08-ae1f-a101027f38e9 |

First, we filter the DataFrame for specific values in the 'CL Scheme' column.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               | 2. Then, we calculate the conditional sums for each part of the CASE WHEN clause.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

This is because `np.where` is vectorized and the division operation `(sum_6_13 + sum_7_14 + sum_8_15) / sum_13_14_15` is performed regardless of the condition `sum_13_14_15 == 0`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | finished_successfully | aaa2baa9-adb8-4fff-b5d8-f048ab15b818 |

The `np.where` function is not lazy, it doesn't prevent the division operation from running when the condition is met.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | finished_successfully | aaa22c7a-954c-4a4e-8622-dc42eb871ddc |

Also, please keep in mind that we need to perform these operations inside the groupby function as well, because the sums need to be calculated for each group, not the entire DataFrame. Here is how we can do it:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

This function is then applied to each group in the DataFrame after grouping. After this, we rename the new column created by the `apply` function to 'REP CL Scheme', add the new columns and finally append to the `final_df`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

It's not tied exclusively to Databricks and can be used with any Spark installation. Delta Lake provides ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and unifies streaming and batch data processing on top of existing data lakes. It essentially converts a batch of data into a series of versioned parquet files in your data lake, enabling you to keep a history of all the changes.                                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

In a traditional data lake, it would be challenging to handle this streaming data alongside historical batch data. With Delta Lake, you can merge the streaming data with the historical data in a transactional, reliable way, creating a unified view of your data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

It refers to the specific table stored in the Delta Lake. The Delta Table is a table that's been created in your Delta Lake. You can perform operations such as insert, update, and delete on a Delta Table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

You can update this table to reflect new incoming data, you can modify existing data (such as correcting erroneous sensor readings), and you can delete data that's no longer relevant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

This operation includes two steps: subtracting the money from the first account, and adding it to the second. If a system failure occurs after the first step, atomicity ensures the whole operation is rolled back, so the money isn't lost. Consistency maintains that the total amount of money in the system remains the same. Isolation ensures that other transactions (e.g., calculating total deposits) won't be affected by this incomplete transaction. Durability guarantees that once the money has been transferred, the transaction will not be reversed. |                       |                                      |

Some APIs impose such limits to maintain performance and prevent misuse. This is often implemented through a pagination mechanism, which breaks the data into smaller chunks (or "pages") that you retrieve with multiple requests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | finished_successfully | ae7fc348-6e21-401c-b294-1bf0ef1ff552 |

The specifics of how to implement this depends on the API. Some APIs require you to specify `page` and `limit` (or `offset` and `limit`) parameters in the URL, while others provide a `next` link in the response that you simply follow to get the next page of data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

Note that this example assumes the API uses a `page` query parameter to control pagination. If the API uses a different mechanism (like `offset`, `cursor`, or a `next` link in the response), you'll need to adjust the code accordingly. Also, it assumes that an empty 'data' indicates the end of data, this might need to be changed based on actual API response.                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

If it still gives a 500 error, then the error might be due to something else other than your pagination implementation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

Print out the entire response body and see if there's more information you can use to debug.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

They could provide more specific guidance or fix the server issue if it's on their side.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

Be sure to use exponential backoff (where the delay between retries increases exponentially) to avoid overwhelming the server with requests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

So it's crucial to refer to that as your primary source of truth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

'limit' specifies the number of records to return and 'offset' specifies the starting point from which to return records.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | finished_successfully | aaa29eb5-4401-401a-b4fc-8637c299eefe |

For each iteration, we increase the offset by the limit, effectively moving the "window" of data we fetch from the API each time. This allows us to retrieve the data in chunks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

If the API does not support pagination through 'limit' and 'offset', you will get an error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

This can help you understand if the issue is with your code or with the API itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |

Print the entire error response (e.g., `print(response.text)`). There might be more information that could help you figure out what's going wrong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

The server may be expecting different parameters or different parameter values. For example, the 'Currency' parameter value is URL-encoded, which may or may not be necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

In that case, I would recommend reaching out to the API provider's support team. They can likely provide more insight into what's causing the 500 error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

|      |                                      |               |               | 4. **Server-side Changes**: If you have control or influence over the server side, consider modifying the API to support pagination. This would make fetching large datasets easier and more efficient.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

This won't solve the problem if the data set is too large to be returned in a single response, but it can help if the issue is due to making too many requests too quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

This would create a separate request for each combination of month and version. We'll then append the data from each request to our DataFrame.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | finished_successfully | aaa2938a-33d6-4261-b507-8e3c91cce05e |

You can do this by navigating to the path in your file explorer and verifying that the file is there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

To avoid this, you can make the string a raw string by prefixing it with an `r`, like so: `r"\\Kficwpnxappp01\g\Board\Dataset\Reporting_Project\Tree_Relation.txt"`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |
