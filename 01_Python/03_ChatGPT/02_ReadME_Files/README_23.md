If it fails to find or read the file, it simply ignores the command and continues with the next line of the script. It doesn't raise an error and doesn't halt script execution.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

Use `$(Must_Include)` when you want to include a file and it is essential for your script to run correctly. If the file is not found or cannot be read, the script will fail, alerting you to the issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

You would assign your admins to the 'Admin' role, and your users to the 'User' role. The users will then see different data in the report based on their role.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

First, the SELECT statement implies you're trying to load from an SQL source, but your LIB CONNECT statement suggests you're connecting to a Qlik File System (QS_FS). Second, your SQL SELECT statement is not properly constructed for a Qlik Sense data load script.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                       |                                      |

Instead, the loaded data is stored in memory and used to calculate values for visualizations. If you need to export data, this is done separately through either a data export option in the Qlik Sense UI, or using an API to programmatically export data.                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

After creating the backup file, you could use Python to split the file into parts, then recombine the parts and restore from the combined file. But it is important to note that this might result in corruption of the backup file and may not be recommended for crucial data.                                                                                      |                       |                                      |

Here's an example that creates a cursor object, executes a SQL query, and fetches the results:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                       |                                      |

A Dockerfile is a script containing a series of instructions to build a Docker image. In your case, you can use it to create an image of code-server with pandas pre-installed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | finished_successfully | aaa25d93-5ff5-44a4-9e32-486ab6cb9aab |

If you're trying to drop a table that was created in a part of the script not included here, then of course you should keep that line.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

If you want to use this statement, you need to uncomment it and put it in the correct place. For instance, if you want to load only records where `POACC_Year` exists in a previously loaded table, you can add the statement to the `Sales_Final` load script:                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

Regarding the two damage you mentioned in your previous mail, we already discussed with Cornelia before that we received the flat like that and that damage is not belonged to us at all , don’t know if she already discussed with Mr. Brose about that or not, anyhow as we didn’t take a pictures from the flat when we received so in that case it’s out fault , so Thanks to deduct the full amount in the next payroll ..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

On the matter of the two instances of damage you brought up in your last email, I'd like to remind you that we had spoken to Cornelia earlier, stating that we received the apartment in its current condition and we're not responsible for the said damages. I'm unsure whether Cornelia conveyed this to Mr. Brose. Regrettably, we did not photograph the apartment upon moving in, and in this case, we accept that the responsibility falls on us. Therefore, we appreciate your decision to deduct the full cost from our upcoming payroll. |                       |                                      |

This means each new record will get an ID that is larger than any ID before it. This can be a reasonable assumption if you control the data input process and the ID field is never manually set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | finished_successfully | a9a9c5ca-b89c-49e1-9a72-f36d379ab9d9 |

This ensures that your table is always up-to-date, but it can be slow and resource-intensive if you have a lot of data. Also, be aware that you'd lose all data not present in your source files.                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

There are several ways to implement CDC depending on your source data and database system:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

For example, SQL Server has a CDC feature that you can enable on your tables, which creates a change table that tracks inserts, updates, and deletes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

This can be complex to set up and may miss changes if your source data can change frequently in between your snapshots.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |

Delete the file manually: Once you've ensured that no other processes are using the file, navigate to the file location ('F:\PlanX\SSIS\HLAG PlanX\HLAG PlanX\bin\Development\') and attempt to manually delete the 'HLAG PlanX.ispac' file. If the deletion is successful, it should resolve the issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |
