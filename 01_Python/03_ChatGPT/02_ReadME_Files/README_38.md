The OVER() clause with a PARTITION BY statement is used to group the rows by the first character of "geo_string" when its length is 1.                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

The UNION operator eliminates duplicate rows from the combined result set by default, but you can also include duplicate rows if needed using the UNION ALL operator.                                                                                                                                                                  | finished_successfully | 792d0cd1-e99b-4211-bc05-27f76cfb97e4 |

If you need to start the search at a specific position, you can use the `SUBSTR()` function to extract a substring of the original string starting at the desired position, and then apply the `POSITION()` function to the extracted substring.                           |                       |                                      |

Here's an example:                                                                                                                                                                                                                | finished_successfully | 73a9f895-b81c-4961-95be-1555c3e1714f |

Then we convert the remaining values in the `date_str` column to datetime format using `pd.to_datetime()`. The resulting dataframe only contains the rows with valid date values.                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

The lower bound is calculated as Q1 - (1.5 * IQR), and the upper bound is calculated as Q3 + (1.5 * IQR). Any data point outside of these bounds can be considered an outlier.                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

However, this assumption may not hold true for all datasets. In some cases, you may need to adjust the multiplier or use a different method to detect outliers based on the characteristics of the data.                                          |                       |                                      |

Using a smaller multiplier, such as 1.0 or 1.3, will result in more stringent criteria for identifying outliers, while using a larger multiplier, such as 2.0 or 3.0, will result in a more lenient approach. It is important to choose an appropriate method based on the context and goals of the analysis. |                       |                                      |

This can help Pandas infer the correct data type, which can improve performance. You can specify the data types as a dictionary where the keys are the column names and the values are the corresponding data types. Here's an example:                                                                                                                         | finished_successfully | 1d4dd91b-2831-4eeb-a971-ed4d44ad784d |

This can be useful if your CSV file has many columns that you don't need, as it can help reduce the memory usage and improve performance. You can specify the columns to read as a list of column names or column indices. Here's an example:                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |
