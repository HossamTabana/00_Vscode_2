This will give you the latest entry considering both `timestamp` and `lastchange` for each unique ID where `operationid` is not 'D'. Don't forget to replace `your_table_name` with the actual name of your Athena table.                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

Create a trigger on the `sys.objects` system table to automatically update the `SQL_Data` table when a new table, view, or stored procedure is created.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

Aggregation Function: The subquery uses the array_agg function to aggregate the _header__operation_type_1 column values for each group (formed by grouping on FK_TS0340NUMBER and FK_TS0340CLIENT). The aggregation function creates an array of distinct values of _header__operation_type_1 for each group. This aggregated array is then aliased as last_operations.                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

If a row from the _ts0370_max table has no matching row in the subquery result, the row is still included in the final result set, with NULL values for the columns from the subquery result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

You can achieve this using the following corrected formula in a QlikView textbox:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | finished_successfully | aaa28c9e-031e-4c0c-a4bd-65a11f357848 |

In this case, you will need to use the P() function to include only the values of dimensions from the 'FIS' table. Assuming DP voyage and GEO are the main dimensions you need to consider, you can use the following formula:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | finished_successfully | aaa2d702-7fe0-475b-a901-3aefccb1ca69 |

To count the number of relations and DP voyages where the sum of the [NET-TEU AL] field is equal to zero, you can use the following formula:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | finished_successfully | aaa2c088-3849-4e75-8ae8-b9f9036a7afd |

If you have a variable that stores the result of the previous expression and you want to count the number of DP voyages where this variable is equal to zero, you can use the following formula:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | finished_successfully | aaa2ca24-0b65-429a-a6f8-fe830f24d9ca |

First, create a variable named `vSum_NET_TEU_AL` (or any other name you prefer) in QlikView and set its definition to the expression we derived earlier:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

Since you want to count the number of DP voyages where the sum of [NET-TEU AL] is equal to zero, we can use an advanced search on the dimension [DP voyage] and the variable `vSum_NET_TEU_AL`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | finished_successfully | aaa25197-afba-451d-a44f-454191b37788 |

Since `vL.Delta` is equal to `SUM(TEUs) - SUM(NEW TEUs)`, we can directly use this expression in the set analysis for counting DP voyages.

You can try using the Trim() function to remove extra spaces from the field name. Here's how you can do it:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | finished_successfully | aaa26b7a-005e-44ea-ad9c-416a2a42ce59 |

First, you can use the Trim() function in the field name itself:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

Keep in mind that this modification may impact other resources that rely on these subnets.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                       |                                      |

Ensure that these new subnets are associated with the same VPC as the SageMaker app.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                       |                                      |

This can be done by modifying the VPC's CIDR block to include a larger IP address range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                       |                                      |

The IAM role should have the necessary permissions to access the AWS service you are trying to use (e.g., SageMaker). The credentials will be automatically provided to your code when using IAM roles.                                                                                                                                  |                       |                                      |

The file should have the following format:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

It is provided by Schufa Holding AG, a private credit bureau that collects and analyzes data on borrowers to generate a credit score ranging from 0 to 1000. A higher score typically represents a lower risk of default, while a lower score indicates a higher risk.                                                                                                                                                           | finished_successfully | aaa28dce-48bd-4cd2-86b2-1634db853ea4 |

In Hamburg, as in the rest of Germany, lenders and landlords often rely on Schufa scores when deciding whether to extend credit or rent a property to someone. With a score of 458, an individual might encounter higher interest rates, more stringent requirements, or outright rejection when applying for loans, credit cards, or rental properties.     |                       |                                      |

A score of 458 might be acceptable to some, while others might require a higher score for approval. It is always a good idea to work on improving one's credit score by making timely payments, keeping debt levels low, and regularly checking and correcting any errors on the credit report.                                                                                   |                       |                                      |
