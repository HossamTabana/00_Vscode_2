I am writing to inform you about an unexpected issue that we have encountered with our washing machine. Upon waking up today, we were astonished to discover that the glass window of the washing machine has been shattered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

Furthermore, it is hard to imagine that the contents of the machine, such as clothing, could have led to the breaking of the glass. It is possible that the glass has reached the end of its lifespan, but we cannot say for certain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

If there is one, we kindly request that you arrange for its delivery to our letter box at your earliest convenience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

We recently received a call from Heinrich-Wolgast-Schule, informing us that Asser has been accepted into Grundschule Neugraben. We have been scheduled for a meeting at the new school on April 19th at 7:45 AM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

We understand that it may not be possible to secure a placement for Asser in a closer school this year.

I am writing to inform you that we recently received a call from Asser's current school, Heinrich-Wolgast-Schule. They notified us that Asser has been accepted at Grundschule Neugraben and that we are scheduled to attend a meeting at the new school on April 19th at 7:45 AM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

While we understand that it may not be feasible to place Asser in a closer school at the moment, we kindly ask if there is any possibility of considering a transfer to a closer school in the upcoming academic year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

It's wonderful to have the opportunity to chat with you and Martin. As someone who has benefited greatly from working as a data scientist at HL, I highly recommend this role to others. It's like having a whole world open up to you, and it's very fulfilling to work collaboratively with others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | finished_successfully | a8e919ca-c3a5-4a08-82e6-823dc39832c6 |

I'm also waiting for my belongings from Italy to arrive and have ordered new furniture for the flat. Additionally, I'm looking for a school for my son as he will also be moving with me. I will be on holiday from tomorrow until the 23rd of April. If it's possible, we can have a meeting tomorrow from 13:30 to 14:00 via Teams. However, if that's not convenient for you, we can schedule the meeting for after my return from holiday. I'm really excited to meet you and Martin, and I look forward to hearing from you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

As of June 2019, a new regulation came into effect that requires riders of e-scooters to have a valid driver's license for cars or motorcycles, or a special e-scooter license. The special e-scooter license can be obtained by completing a theoretical and practical training course at a driving school, which includes topics such as traffic regulations, safe driving techniques, and handling the scooter. Additionally, riders must be at least 14 years old to use an e-scooter in Germany.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | finished_successfully | fe97187f-9f4b-499f-83da-8f59ede71a39 |

You can check the transaction log to see if any errors occurred during the insert operation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

Overwrite: If the CSV file you used to insert data had the same name as an existing table, the insert operation may have overwritten the existing table. Make sure to use a unique name for your CSV file, or use a separate database schema or table name to avoid conflicts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

Access Restrictions: It is also possible that the user account used to insert data into the table does not have the necessary permissions to do so. Check the user's permissions to ensure that they have the necessary INSERT permissions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

Truncation: Another possibility is that the table was truncated after the insert operation, which would remove all data from the table. Check if any truncation operation was performed on the table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

Note that the transaction log can be quite large, so you may want to add additional filters to limit the results to a specific time period or transaction ID. Also, keep in mind that the transaction log may have been truncated, so it may not contain information for the time period you are interested in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

It appears that some of the columns used in the previous query are not available in SQL Server versions later than SQL Server 2000. Here is an updated version of the query that should work on newer versions of SQL Server:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | finished_successfully | a2893ebc-878a-4716-8a20-8581ee1d85ef |

Alternatively, you could try inserting the data into a new table with a different name to see if that makes a difference. If you are still experiencing issues, you may want to contact your database administrator or support team for assistance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

Scheduled Jobs: It is possible that there is a scheduled SQL Server Agent job or task that is deleting the data each day. Check the SQL Server Agent job schedule to see if there is a job that is executing at the same time each day and review its code to see if it is deleting the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

Foreign Key Constraints: If the table has foreign key constraints that reference other tables, it is possible that the data in those tables is being deleted, which in turn deletes the data from your table. Check the foreign key constraints to see if they are configured to cascade deletes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

Permissions: It is possible that the user account used to insert data into the table does not have the necessary permissions to do so, and the data is being deleted by another user with higher permissions. Check the user's permissions to ensure that they have the necessary INSERT permissions and that there are no other users with higher permissions that are deleting the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

If you are unable to determine the cause of the issue, you may want to contact your database administrator or support team for assistance. In the meantime, you can try creating a backup of the table data before each insert operation, so that you can restore the data if it is deleted again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

If the original QVD file is not sorted or contains missing or duplicate row numbers, you may need to modify the `Where` clause to select the correct rows for each block.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

If the above steps don't solve the issue, you may want to try simplifying the code and testing it on a smaller QVD file to isolate the issue. For example, you could try loading a small QVD file with only a few rows, and setting `RowsPerQVD` to a small value like 2 or 3.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

You are correct that the `DataBlock` table cannot be read as a separate table because it is a temporary table created only for the purpose of storing the rows that are to be saved in the current QVD file. The correct way to save the rows in the current block to a new QVD file is to use the `Resident` load statement directly in the `Store` statement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | finished_successfully | c7b288d8-98e3-47ad-8551-84b8c14ffe20 |
