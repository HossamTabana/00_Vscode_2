Both methods work similarly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | finished_successfully | aaa268e3-fba1-4218-a471-bef97a5fd6b0 |

If you're experiencing a delay, it's most likely because PySpark operations are lazily evaluated. This means that when you define transformations (like `select()`), they are not immediately executed. Instead, they are only executed when you perform an action like `show()`, `collect()`, `write()`, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | finished_successfully | aaa2e5ac-6cef-4774-904e-cf975e2cc9a3 |

Depending on your data and the available resources, you might want to repartition your data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

The key to achieving this is to handle special characters like commas and semicolons in the script since they can interfere with the SQL query syntax.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | finished_successfully | aaa23f73-4370-4d55-af33-b3a563d45b05 |

This way, you can store the script content in an SQL table without syntax errors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | finished_successfully | aaa26d15-eb97-498e-8687-a00c7ac4784d |

Parameterized queries are safer to prevent SQL injection, although in your use case (using script data) the main concern would be syntax errors rather than injection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                       |                                      |

Ensure the user running this Python code has the necessary permissions and access rights to execute scripts, especially when those scripts involve database operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

If you want to have a single quote inside a string wrapped with single quotes, you can use a backslash (`\`) before the single quote.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

Triple quotes in Python can be used for multi-line strings, but they also can be used for single-line strings. If you want to embed both single and double quotes within a string without escaping them, this is a good choice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |

Still, be cautious of other special characters or SQL-specific syntax that might need to be escaped or handled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

If you're going to upload the script directly to an SQL database, it's essential to handle the single quotes since they can conflict with the SQL syntax. The most common method to handle single quotes in SQL strings is to double them up (`'` becomes `''`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | finished_successfully | b9473236-fb15-4451-9918-9fe742f07771 |

The approach we're using to encode and then decode the Python script appears to be introducing or retaining extraneous characters, which is causing the error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | finished_successfully | aaa2203f-a903-4ecb-8f5d-7e445cd54b41 |

This could be redundant, though, if you're importing the same module both outside and inside the script.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

This way, the script can access anything that's been imported or defined in the main environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                       |                                      |

Delta supports operations like `OPTIMIZE` which can compact small files into larger ones for more efficient reads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

Every day run the notebook to have insert / delete / update compared with the data already inserted in the table in snowflake and add the incremental and this incremental should work in both side means if one row has to be delete from the table in snowflake so delete and if compared to the foreign keys additional rows should be updated in snowflake so please updated                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

The MERGE operation, often termed as "upsert" (for "insert" + "update"), allows you to maintain the latest version of a dataset in Snowflake. You'll use Delta Lake's features in Databricks to make this process efficient.

Let's delve deeper into handling those scenarios.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | finished_successfully | 83c591da-1c5a-4512-9358-9d9baec3498b |

However, setting up an ODBC connection in Databricks can be a bit more involved than using JDBC, and the direct support in Spark for ODBC isn't as strong as JDBC.

Instead, it reads/writes directly from/to local disk files. In the context of Databricks, if you want to use SQLite, you would typically be working with small, local databases directly within the notebook environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | finished_successfully | aaa28ae0-714e-4953-ad06-fa097746a293 |

If you want to replace the table entirely, you can use `if_exists='replace'`. The `index=False` argument ensures that the DataFrame's index isn't inserted into the database as a separate column.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

If the repository exceeds these quotas, you'll be billed for the additional storage and bandwidth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |

You'd need to migrate them to LFS, which is a bit more involved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |

However, if the `.mp4` files or other large assets don't need versioning, consider storing them outside of the Git repository and provide links or references to their location within your project documentation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                       |                                      |

Check the error details or GitHub's LFS usage page to determine if this is the issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

A pre-receive hook is a custom script on the server side (in this case, on GitHub) that runs when you try to push commits.

Check with the repository owner or admin to see if there are any specific rules or conditions that your push needs to meet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |

GitHub has a strict file size limit. Ensure your push doesn't contain files larger than 100 MB.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |

If not, you might need to sign your commits using GPG.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

For example, they might require pull request reviews before merging or require status checks to pass. If you're pushing to a protected branch, ensure you meet all the criteria.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

You can check your usage on GitHub's LFS page for your repository.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

If you're sure you want to push your rewritten history, you'd have to temporarily disable this protection or use a new branch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                       |                                      |

Ensure to read the entire output for any specific messages or guidelines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

Since you're the owner of the repository and aren't using any custom server-side hooks (GitHub doesn't support them for standard repositories), there might be a deeper issue. GitHub support can give more insights into what's causing the rejection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |

However, the way you're using `input()` is incorrect for this purpose. The `input()` function is used to prompt the user for input, and the string passed to it is merely a prompt message, not a default value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | finished_successfully | aaa2cc5f-3352-4563-b590-d28b8097a1dc |

There is a bundled script with the Python installation to ensure the necessary SSL certificates are installed. Find "Install Certificates.command" in your Python installation folder and double-click to run it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

Since this error is SSL-related, and assuming that you're doing this on a trusted network and for personal use, you can temporarily disable SSL verification. But, remember this is not a recommended approach for production or sensitive applications due to security concerns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | finished_successfully | aaa2c81c-2deb-4175-899e-4e1f7e803828 |
