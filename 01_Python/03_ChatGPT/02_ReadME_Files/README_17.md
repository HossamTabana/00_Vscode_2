In your case, if you want to use space as a delimiter, you can do it like this:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | finished_successfully | aaa23faf-ba4d-4910-884b-94912afbe946 |

In the `merge()` function, use `left_on` and `right_on` to specify the column names in the left (first) and right (second) dataframes respectively. Here's how you can do it:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | finished_successfully | aaa2e062-b34d-44a9-8a5d-49bd92c52a8c |

It also can be challenging to manage access control to data at a granular level in a data lake environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

This makes the serverless option more attractive for unpredictable or varying workloads. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, details about Photon, costs, performance degradation, and startup times in the context of serverless Databricks SQL warehouses are not clearly specified.                                              |                       |                                      |

As a result, Databricks helped to develop the solution, Delta Sharing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

This level of granularity helps to clearly separate and organize data across various workspaces, databases, and objects, which is especially useful in multi-tenant or large-scale data environments.                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

They result in lower costs by not overprovisioning: Serverless compute resources are designed to scale automatically based on the workload, which helps to avoid overprovisioning and thus can lead to cost savings. In contrast, classic resources may require manual scaling and can lead to overprovisioning if not properly managed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

As for location, both classic and serverless resources are located within the cloud, not making it a differentiating factor.                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

Lack of ACID transaction support: Databricks' Delta Lake provides ACID transaction guarantees, enabling reliable and consistent data operations, which is a common challenge in traditional data lake architectures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

Too many small files: Delta Lake, part of the Databricks Lakehouse Platform, also has mechanisms to handle "small file problems" in data lakes. It does this by optimizing file sizes and reducing the number of small files, which can improve overall performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

"Serverless clusters" could be considered an accurate description for serverless Databricks SQL warehouses, but as a separate option in this list, it might be referring to something else, and there's no specific Databricks offering known as "serverless clusters" as of September 2021.                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

These integrations allow organizations to leverage Databricks' capabilities while still using their preferred tools for specific tasks or use cases. As of my last training data in September 2021, Databricks primarily operates in the cloud and doesn't directly provide local or on-premises versions of its platform. And, indeed, Databricks can be used alongside other big data tools and platforms.     |                       |                                      |

Table schema evolution: Table schema evolution helps to maintain data quality by allowing changes to a table's schema over time, ensuring that the structure of the data always matches its real-world representation. This means that when the nature of the data changes, the schema can change with it, preventing mismatches and errors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

Automatic deployment and data operations: Automation in deployment and data operations reduces manual efforts, chances of errors, and helps maintain consistency. This makes the work of data engineers much simpler and more efficient, as they can focus more on the design and optimization of the data pipelines rather than the operational details.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

This can increase performance because the query doesn't need to wait for the other transaction to complete. But it can also lead to dirty reads, which means the data being read might not be committed and could still be rolled back.                                                                                                                                                                                             | finished_successfully | 146067c8-093f-44c5-9096-ff75c6b8660a |

Partitioning is a way of dividing a table into related parts based on the values of particular columns like date, city, or department. These partitions work like virtual columns, allowing you to increase query performance by restricting the amount of data scanned by each query, hence reducing costs and time.                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

Let's say you have a dataset of sales records in S3, stored as CSV files, and each file represents a different year. Here's how you could create a partitioned table for this data:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | finished_successfully | 4edc4026-583c-462a-b88d-829db719bee9 |

It enables multiple users to concurrently read and write (insert, delete, update) data into tables, while keeping the data consistent and complete.                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

The data in this zone is often in its original format and has not yet been cleansed or transformed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

Each file would be a collection of log entries, and no further processing would have been done on them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

This zone often contains data that's been flattened, filtered, or otherwise processed in some way to make it more useful for analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               |     Example: You might process the JSON logs from the bronze zone to extract useful fields, convert timestamps to a common format, handle missing or erroneous data, etc. The result would be a clean, structured dataset that's easier to analyze.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               | 3. **Gold (business) zone**: The final stage is the gold zone. This zone contains business-level aggregates often used for reporting and dashboarding. This data is typically highly structured and optimized for querying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

For your information, several of us from various regions and areas, including myself, are looking to automate the process of generating reports from SAP and transferring them to Qlik/Qlikview. Unfortunately, we do not currently have access to connect from Qlik to SAP or even to BW, leading us to consider using Alteryx as a possible solution. However, if we are able to establish a connection in the headquarters, and with the regional colleagues, the need to create a connection from Alteryx to SAP will be eliminated. |                       |                                      |

You want the result to be 13310 but are getting 13.310650. You can multiply the final value by 1000 to adjust the decimal point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | finished_successfully | aaa2e243-af52-4758-bc3a-4ae347e8dd5e |

The value is being incorrectly interpreted due to the comma and period placements in your locale. This happens because in some locales (like many European countries), the comma `,` is used as a decimal separator and the period `.` is used as a thousand separator. Whereas, in other locales (like US), the period `.` is used as a decimal separator and the comma `,` as a thousand separator.                                                                                                                                        | finished_successfully | aaa26a06-c4fe-4623-9714-9e7303d25afa |

The outer `REPLACE(....,',','.')` then replaces the comma `,` with a period `.`. The result of these replacements would turn the string '13,310.650000' into the numeric value `13310.650000`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

Your database table seems to be storing `Unit Price` as a string and using a comma `,` as the thousand separator and a period `.` as the decimal point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | finished_successfully | aaa27ea9-0220-48e9-bd92-ffd59f7ec110 |

The logic applied here considers that all numbers will have a comma for thousand separator, which is not the case for numbers less than 1,000. In such case, we will need to apply a condition to only perform the replacement when there is a comma `,` in the string.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | finished_successfully | aaa2ac1e-9b6b-45bc-8e53-758de19b6334 |

To do this, you'll need to use a Script Task within SSIS to call the API, and then parse the result and store it in your database.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | finished_successfully | e4d4b6b0-fe2a-4304-8ac1-60bf65bebb8d |
