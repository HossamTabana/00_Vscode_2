The error message indicates that the format is malformed at "01-01-01".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | finished_successfully | 1e02e27c-3adf-4187-8052-d9b3d10e9d72 |

To parse it correctly, you should use the '%Y-%m-%d' format specifier. Here's an example of how to do this with the `date_parse` function in Athena:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

Unfortunately, the Markdown preview in Visual Studio Code has security restrictions that prevent it from opening local and network file links directly. This is to protect your system from potentially malicious files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | finished_successfully | cbf1d1a6-a107-4b42-9c4c-9aefa154fbb2 |

To do this, use the Week() function to get the week number and the Year() function to get the year, then concatenate both results in a single variable. Here's how to do it in Qlik Sense:                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | finished_successfully | aaa2ad01-c943-4e29-b00a-1ad98d8f078b |

You are correct that Athena does not natively support the `LEFT()` function as it uses Presto SQL. Instead, you can use the `SUBSTR()` or `SUBSTRING()` function to achieve the same result. Here's how you can do it:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | finished_successfully | 203fb129-41f9-43f2-8e8e-8c85d01b28e1 |

Replace the sample data in the INLINE table with your actual data. The script calculates the duration between the terminal port start and end dates and computes the daily cost by dividing the total cost by the duration. The cost is then distributed over the date range using the `IterNo()` function.                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

It proceeds to calculate the cost per month and generates a cost spread table with each row containing the start and end dates for a particular month and the corresponding cost. Finally, it drops the temporary tables created during the process.                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

To do this, you'll need to create a calendar table and use a loop to distribute the revenue proportionally across the period. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:                                                                                                                                                                                                 | finished_successfully | f19e93ff-7d80-43ba-a6df-626556ababd5 |

Additionally, you will need to create a folder connection in Qlik Sense to point to the desired output folder on your C drive. You can find more information on how to create folder connections in Qlik Sense [here](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense/September2021/Subsystems/Hub/Content/Sense_Hub/Data/create-data-connection.htm). |                       |                                      |

It appears that the script is unable to find the 'TempTable' when running the STORE command. This error might be due to a few reasons, such as Qlik Sense not recognizing the table name or the table being dropped before the STORE command executes. Let's try modifying the script slightly to resolve this issue.                                                                                                                                          | finished_successfully | cf9f1d87-cc0a-4b7c-8d66-945376e14738 |

Then, we create a new table `FilteredData` to store the filtered data based on the current chunk, and store this data as a CSV file. Finally, we drop the filtered data and the current chunk to free up memory.

Based on the error message, it seems that the calculation of the `numChunks` variable might be causing the problem. Let's isolate the issue and print out the variable values to understand the problem better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | finished_successfully | d655ec70-a5c1-4c25-9249-5a0c268b1ebc |

Based on the error message, it seems that the FilteredData table is not being created properly. Let's modify the script to use an INLINE LOAD statement to create a separate table with the row numbers we want to filter by, and then join the two tables to get the filtered data. Here's the updated script:                                                                                                                                         | finished_successfully | beaa986f-7918-435f-b593-ca4e4d1456d8 |

It appears the filename is not being generated correctly in the STORE statement, causing the error. Let's make sure the filename is generated correctly by updating the STORE statement in the script.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | finished_successfully | 714cf989-ae88-44e2-8f89-dcc66d328b3a |

They are executed quickly, usually within one business day, and use standardized data formats (IBAN and BIC). This simplifies transactions and reduces the potential for errors.                                                                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

SEPA Direct Debits (SDD): This is a system that allows businesses and individuals to collect recurring payments directly from a payer's bank account. Direct debits are often used for recurring bills, such as utilities, subscriptions, or insurance premiums. To set up a direct debit, the payer must provide a signed mandate, which grants the payee permission to collect the specified funds from their account.                                                                   |                       |                                      |

It ensures that cardholders can use their debit or credit cards anywhere in the SEPA area with the same ease and security as in their home country.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                       |                                      |

The time it takes for the funds to be deducted from your bank account depends on several factors, including the type of direct debit and the processing times of the involved banks.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | finished_successfully | e4809f98-6a32-4fe6-b394-7e292ceb5464 |

The payee (e.g., Amazon) must pre-notify the payer (you) about the amount and due date at least 14 calendar days before the payment is due, although this period can be shortened by agreement between both parties.                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

The pre-notification period is reduced to only one day, but the payer must have a signed agreement with their bank to accept B2B direct debits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

Once the payee submits the direct debit request, it may take one or more business days for the transaction to be completed. For example, if you make a purchase on Amazon and they initiate a SEPA Direct Debit, the funds may not be deducted from your account immediately. It could take a few days for the transaction to be processed and reflected in your account balance.                                                   |                       |                                      |

To avoid any potential issues, it is a good idea to have sufficient funds in your account to cover the transaction amount on the expected date of the direct debit.                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |
