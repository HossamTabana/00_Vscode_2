Often, during the monthly result process, we may need to fetch this data up to four times daily. If we could automate this procedure, it would greatly enhance our efficiency, eliminating the time-consuming tasks of downloading and updating the Qlikview. We could then directly utilize Alteryx for our report review, which would be a more streamlined approach.                      | finished_successfully | aaa2b07b-6981-4f6b-bfc2-5b327d508b62 |

This data is then transformed into a QVD file via Qlikview before being uploaded into the frontend. Due to the fact that the data is manually retrieved from SAP, the entire procedure remains manual, as we currently lack the capability to automate the Qlikview component.                                                                                                                                    | finished_successfully | aaa29c26-5da7-4017-86f5-4350ff0dea32 |

Try disabling all extensions, and then gradually re-enable them one by one to see if the issue reappears. This process can help identify if a specific extension is the root of the problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

It's possible that the table is designed in a way that it does not resize well, or the webpage might have code that prevents it from being displayed correctly in an iframe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

However, for the height, you're not specifying the unit. Browsers may not interpret the height correctly without a unit. For a height of 2000 pixels, you would specify `2000px`. Try the following code:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | finished_successfully | aaa2252b-0625-43a6-831c-9ce08ffb6117 |

When you print a webpage that includes an iframe, it's usually the case that only the visible portion of the iframe will print. This means that if the content inside your iframe has scrollbars, only the content currently in view will print, not the whole iframe content.                                                                                                                                                                                            | finished_successfully | aaa25dea-0408-4826-a942-ad7367ce6207 |

With a print CSS, you can hide elements that aren't necessary for the printed version, change the size of the elements, change colors, etc. Here's an example of how you might modify your code to create a better print layout:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |

The print feature only prints what's visible in the iframe at the time of printing. It's a browser restriction and there is no simple CSS or JavaScript workaround to make it print the entire scrolled content.                                                                                                                                                          | finished_successfully | aaa2d5a3-9f7b-400c-97a7-565f5679a101 |

Depending on what you're trying to achieve, there could be various ways to do that, but they would most likely involve server-side programming and wouldn't be as straightforward as writing HTML/CSS/JavaScript code.                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

This would bypass the iframe entirely and give you full control over the layout and appearance of the printed document.

For instance, you could break up the table into smaller tables, remove unnecessary elements, or adjust the layout so that it fits within the visible area of the iframe. This would likely require changes to the webpage that is being embedded in the iframe.                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

It's also important to understand that due to the nature of iframes, content within an iframe on a different domain cannot be accessed due to the same-origin policy, which is a crucial security feature of web browsers.                                                                                                                                                                 | finished_successfully | aaa20c70-b25b-4fc8-9689-9376b7009daa |

Below is a simple example of how this could work:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

If your data is inside an iframe from a different domain, due to security restrictions known as the same-origin policy, you can't extract data from the iframe using JavaScript on the parent page. You would need to have a method to access your data directly, possibly from an API or a database.                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

This array is then passed to `doc.autoTable()`, which creates a table in the PDF.

The JavaScript code uses these `id`s to target the iframes and retrieve their content. So, you need to add `id="iframe1"` to the first iframe and `id="iframe2"` to the second iframe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                       |                                      |

It's best practice to encapsulate JavaScript code inside a `<script>` tag or place it in a separate JavaScript file. Since you're already linking to a separate file (`script.js`), you should put the function there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

The main problem: As mentioned before, the JavaScript code will not be able to access the content of the iframes because of the same-origin policy. The iframe content is hosted on a different domain (`qliksense-dev.hlag.com`), so the browser blocks the script from reading its content for security reasons. There's no way to bypass this restriction from the client-side.                                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

As explained in my previous responses, this is because of the same-origin policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | finished_successfully | aaa2f47f-c89a-4e03-85c4-1ae8789aad11 |

However, as of my last training cut-off in September 2021, Qlik Sense doesn't support Binary load directly using the application ID, especially in the cloud version of the software.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | finished_successfully | aaa21f2b-9f42-4b3c-a81e-b05154d82f67 |

This can be used to make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to a RESTful web service. However, it requires the API to be RESTful, and the data to be in a tabular format that Qlik Sense can ingest. This doesn't allow using WebSocket protocol (like the Qlik Engine API).                                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |

This process would use the API to fetch the data, process it if needed, and then store it in a database or a flat file that Qlik Sense can then ingest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

Running a .reg file as an administrator is no different from running it as a normal user because once it's executed, it will ask for administrative permissions if it needs them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | finished_successfully | aaa24045-758b-46b4-a568-cc1715930507 |

You can do this by typing "regedit" into the Start menu, selecting it, and then in the Registry Editor window, go to "File" > "Export" > save the backup somewhere you can find it later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                       |                                      |

Unlike applications or batch scripts, you can't choose to run .reg files as an administrator from the right-click context menu. These files should request administrative permissions if they're needed upon execution.                                                                                                                                                                                           | finished_successfully | aaa29035-b56e-4005-9479-eb43c9923353 |

If this is not already open, you can open it by going to `View > Other Windows > Variables` or by simply pressing `Ctrl + Alt + V`. This should bring up a window with the title `Variables`.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

You can see the Name, Value, Scope, Data type, and other properties of each variable. By selecting a variable, you can modify its properties in the properties window.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

If you're using the Direct Query connection, you don't have the option to enable scheduled refresh because the data is always up to date. However, if you're using the Import connection, you should be able to enable the scheduled refresh. Verify that your data source is set to the Import mode.                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

You need to publish your Power BI report to Power BI service first, then set up the refresh schedule there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                       |                                      |

You need to have a Power BI Pro license to use this feature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

In the Gateway connection settings, ensure you have a working gateway installed and configured correctly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

Without correct credentials, Power BI won't be able to connect to your data source, which could disable the scheduled refresh.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

However, with a combination of Query Parameters, the M query language, and a few other features, it's possible to build a system that can allow a form of dynamic table selection.                                                                                                                                                                    | finished_successfully | aaa2c11b-349f-4e52-a442-9a46ba7a6909 |

This will require a table in your model that contains all the possible table names you want to allow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

To automate this process, you can use a service like Power Automate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

It's designed to handle big data and allow for diverse query capabilities, including real-time analytics and machine learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |

The structure and schema are defined in advance. It's optimized for data analysis and reporting, and often integrates data from several disparate sources into one unified view. This makes it a good fit for business intelligence applications.                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

It aims to maintain the flexibility, scale, and cost-effectiveness of data lakes while providing the reliability, performance, and ease-of-use typically associated with data warehouses. It uses a common storage layer for both types of computation, which is typically columnar and storage-efficient. This combination is intended to support all types of data workloads, from machine learning to business intelligence. |                       |                                      |

It's developed by Databricks and it offers ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and unifies streaming and batch data processing on top of existing data lakes. Delta Lake stores data as "Delta Tables" which is essentially a collection of Parquet files along with a transaction log that keeps track of all the changes that have been made to the table.                                                                                                         | finished_successfully | 841832ed-c3c2-430b-951b-c7f602646530 |

Either all of its changes are committed to the database, or if the transaction fails at any point, all of its changes are rolled back. This ensures that the database remains in a consistent state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

This property ensures that the execution of one transaction does not affect other transactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                       |                                      |

In a relational database, for instance, once a group of SQL statements execute, the results need to be stored permanently (even if the database crashes immediately).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                       |                                      |

However, the specifics of setting up the refresh schedule depend on where your data source resides. If you are using Power BI Pro or Premium, you can schedule refreshes for datasets imported from many different sources, such as SQL Server, Azure, Excel workbooks, and more.                                                                                                                                                           | finished_successfully | aaa2e7bc-18a9-4f43-a57e-2c983062e4b2 |

Ensure that your gateway is properly set up, configured, and online. If you don't have permission to manage the gateway, you'll need to contact the gateway owner or admin to ensure it's functioning correctly.                                                                                                                                                                                         |                       |                                      |

This is common with web-based data sources, certain types of file sources, and others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

Make sure you have the appropriate level of access to edit these settings. If you're not the owner of the dataset, you might need to contact the person who owns it to update the credentials or give you permissions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

Therefore, data source credentials can't be managed in Power BI; they're managed in the source system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

Access rights can be managed in QMC under System > Setup > QlikView Servers > Security.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

Ensure that your Section Access is properly configured and that your user credentials in Access Point match those defined in the Section Access.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

You should check the status of the task in the QMC to see if it completed successfully. Also, check the QlikView Distribution Service (QDS) logs for any errors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

If all CALs are allocated, you won't be able to open the document in the Access Point. You can manage and check your licenses in QMC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |

An outdated or malfunctioning server could be the cause of your issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                       |                                      |

You might try distributing the file again to see if this resolves the issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |
