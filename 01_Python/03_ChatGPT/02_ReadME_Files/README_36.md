I've corrected the code by moving the CSV to Parquet conversion and temporary file removal inside the loop:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | finished_successfully | af30b78a-8248-4fad-8fee-e5568393c9e3 |

It seems that the QlikView application is not exporting the QVD files to CSV format as expected. Unfortunately, using QlikView's Qv.exe to export QVD files to CSV format through the command line is not officially supported.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | finished_successfully | 875cdc40-a258-4470-b467-92fbe5700c9f |

If it does, we simply calculate the sum of `tue_allocation`. If it doesn't, we use another `CASE` statement to check whether `valid_to` is greater than the current date. If it is, we include that row's `tue_allocation` value in the sum, otherwise we include a 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                       |                                      |

Without more context, it's hard to say if that's an issue, but assuming it's not, the `ELSE` clause of the `CASE` statement should have a `SUM` function around the second `CASE` statement to make sure the output of the entire `CASE` statement is a single value. Here's the corrected query:                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | finished_successfully | 63dea756-7f44-4b41-b5a8-3956f5c5883e |

If `valid_to` equals '0001-01-01', the first branch of the `CASE` statement will evaluate to 1, which is equal to the condition `1 = 1`, so the row will be included in the sum. If `valid_to` is a date value greater than the current date, the second branch of the `CASE` statement will evaluate to `valid_to > CURRENT_DATE`, which is either true or false. If it's true, the row will be included in the sum; otherwise, it will be excluded. |                       |                                      |

To do this, go to your project page and look for the "Members" option in the sidebar menu. If you don't see it, click the "Settings" button and look for the "Access control" section. If you have "Guest" or "Reporter" access, you won't be able to manage members.

If you have "Developer" or "Maintainer" access, but you're still not seeing the "Members" option, it's possible that the project owner has restricted access to the "Members" page. To check this, go to the project's settings and look for the "Permissions" section. Make sure the "Members" checkbox is selected under "Allowed to access".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                       |                                      |

Double-check that you're using the account that owns the project and that you're not logged in with a different account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                       |                                      |

As the project owner, you should have "Maintainer" access by default, which should allow you to manage project members. To check your access level, go to your project page and look for the "Members" option in the sidebar menu. If you don't see it, click the "Settings" button and look for the "Access control" section. If you have "Developer" or "Maintainer" access, you should be able to manage members.                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

Instead of navigating to the "Settings" page and looking for the "Members" option, try going directly to the URL of the "Members" page. To do this, replace "settings" in the URL of your project page with "members" (e.g., https://gitlab.com/yourusername/yourproject/-/settings/access_control -> https://gitlab.com/yourusername/yourproject/-/members). This should take you directly to the "Members" page.                                                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |

It's possible that there are certain access restrictions in place that are preventing you from managing members. To check this, go to your project's settings and look for the "Permissions" section. Make sure the "Members" checkbox is selected under "Allowed to access".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

Dask can read large datasets in parallel, which can significantly speed up the process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | finished_successfully | 3fb92f78-2feb-4211-b257-66011e1996ac |

Adjust the `npartitions` parameter in `dd.read_parquet` to control the number of partitions used for parallel processing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                       |                                      |

The `pd.read_parquet` function doesn't have a `chunksize` parameter. Instead, you can use the `pd.read_csv` function to read a CSV file in chunks. If you need to read a Parquet file in chunks, you can use Dask, as mentioned earlier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | finished_successfully | d5660f86-9a7f-4796-9313-cbce454bee21 |

Since you want to read Parquet files using Pandas, you can try reading the file in smaller partitions using the `columns` and `row_group` parameters of the `pd.read_parquet` function. This approach requires you to know the structure of the Parquet file and the number of row groups in it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | finished_successfully | a5b6d776-c0e4-4e84-9b32-ba8e3572919b |

However, the efficiency of this method depends on how the Parquet file is partitioned. If you have control over the creation of the Parquet file, you can optimize it by partitioning the data and writing multiple smaller files instead of a single large file. This would make reading the data in chunks more efficient.                                                                                                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |

The correct parameter to use with `pd.read_parquet` for specifying row groups is `row_group` (singular), not `row_groups` (plural).

It reads one row group at a time from the Parquet file, which can help when working with large files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |

It appears that the `row_group` parameter is not supported in the `pd.read_parquet` function. In this case, I recommend using the `pyarrow.parquet` library directly to read row groups from the Parquet file, as shown in the following example:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | finished_successfully | 5a2c79bc-e77c-45b0-b4da-5a12b4aa1b92 |

It should work as expected and help you work with large Parquet files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                       |                                      |

However, the final DataFrame, `result_df`, will still hold the concatenated results in memory. If the result is too large to fit in memory, you may need to perform your operations in a more incremental manner or use out-of-core processing techniques such as Dask.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

Moreover, Dask can handle larger-than-memory datasets, allowing you to work with the data without running out of memory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

Instead, you can use the 'qreader' package, which supports reading QlikView QVD files. To install the 'qreader' package, you can run:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | finished_successfully | efe57452-ba4b-4754-a4bc-a22a50a908ea |

Unfortunately, the 'qreader' package does not support reading QVD files in chunks. However, you can still read the entire QVD file into a DataFrame using the 'qreader' package:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | finished_successfully | f3a2c061-f42c-4f85-8e77-df80a5125bde |

If you need to process the QVD file in chunks, you may need to find or create a custom solution, as there is no straightforward way to do this with the 'qreader' package or any other available package that I am aware of.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

Convert the QVD file to a different file format, such as Parquet or CSV, which are well-supported by Pandas and can be read in chunks. You can do this conversion within QlikView or Qlik Sense before loading the data into your Python environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

Use QlikView or Qlik Sense to break the QVD file into smaller QVD files, which can be read into memory separately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

If possible, preprocess and filter the data within QlikView or Qlik Sense before exporting it to a QVD file to reduce its size.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                       |                                      |

Due to the lack of a suitable package to handle large QVD files directly in Python, it is best to convert the QVD file to a different format or preprocess it using QlikView or Qlik Sense before loading the data into your Python environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

However, you can use a two-step approach to achieve this:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | finished_successfully | 473cf1f9-ea0d-4dfb-8b73-860bdae2528f |

If memory is a concern, you may need to split the QVD file into smaller parts using QlikView or Qlik Sense, then convert each part to a CSV file and subsequently to a Parquet file. Once you have the data in Parquet format, you can read it in chunks using Pandas, as shown in my previous response.                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |
