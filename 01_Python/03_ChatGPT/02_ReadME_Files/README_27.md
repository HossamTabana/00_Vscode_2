Here are some steps to help you improve your credit score:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | finished_successfully | aaa20dba-4ebd-4e21-a4b0-235855ec0069 |

If you find any, contact the credit bureau and the reporting company to have them corrected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               | 2. Make timely payments: Always pay your bills, loans, and credit card balances on time. Late or missed payments can negatively impact your credit score. Setting up automatic payments or reminders can help you stay on track.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               | 3. Reduce debt: Aim to lower your overall debt, especially high-interest debt like credit card balances. Prioritize paying off accounts with the highest interest rates and maintaining low balances on your credit cards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

Keeping this ratio below 30% can positively impact your credit score. Avoid maxing out your credit cards and try to pay off balances in full each month.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

|      |                                      |               |               | 5. Keep old accounts open: The length of your credit history affects your score. Older accounts with good payment history can help improve your score. Avoid closing such accounts, even if you don't use them frequently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

Diversify your credit: Having a mix of different types of credit (e.g., installment loans, credit cards, and mortgages) can show that you can manage different types of debt responsibly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

Limit credit inquiries: Each time you apply for credit, a hard inquiry is made on your credit report, which can temporarily lower your score. Try to minimize the number of credit applications and only apply for credit when necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

Monitor your progress: Regularly check your credit score to track your progress and ensure that your efforts are yielding results. Monitoring your credit score can also help you detect any potential fraud or identity theft.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

Credit scores are designed to assess the creditworthiness of an individual based on their past financial behavior. In the absence of a credit history, credit bureaus may not have enough information to assign a higher score.                                                                    | finished_successfully | aaa299f6-29a8-40b3-bc75-e6c6d82feace |

No local financial relationships: Without any financial relationships in Germany, such as bank accounts, loans, or credit cards, Schufa may have difficulty assessing your financial behavior and assigning a higher credit score.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                       |                                      |

Differences in credit scoring systems: Different countries have different credit scoring systems, and the criteria used to calculate credit scores can vary significantly. What might be considered a good credit behavior in one country might not necessarily have the same impact on your credit score in another.                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

The credit scoring system may not have enough information to generate a higher score for you. Here are some reasons why you might have a lower credit score after recently moving to Hamburg:                                                                                                                         | finished_successfully | aaa299f6-29a8-40b3-bc75-e6c6d82feace |

A limited credit history can result in a lower credit score because the scoring system doesn't have enough data to evaluate your creditworthiness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

Lack of German financial accounts: If you haven't opened any bank accounts or obtained any credit products (e.g., credit cards, loans) in Germany, it could contribute to a lower credit score.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

Records from previous country not considered: Your credit history from your home country may not be considered when generating your credit score in Germany. This means you might be starting from scratch in terms of building your credit profile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

These loans usually have lower interest rates and are an excellent way to demonstrate responsible borrowing behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                       |                                      |

If an error occurs during evaluation, it returns NULL instead. In this query, `try(max(header__event_timestamp, 2)[2])` is used to attempt to get the second highest `header__event_timestamp` value. If the value doesn't exist or an error occurs, it returns NULL.                                                                                         |                       |                                      |

In this case, you can create a general date field by linking the Port Load Date and Port Discharge Date.

If the access token is not shown after creation, there might be an issue with the GitLab interface or a browser-related issue. Here are a few things you can try:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | finished_successfully | aaa2148a-36dc-443a-b7a5-bdb563f0e2d6 |

You can modify the `LOAD` statement and add additional transformations as needed.                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

In Qlik Sense, you can use the `For Each` statement to iterate over values in a field, but the syntax is slightly different. Here's an updated version of the script that should work in Qlik Sense:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | finished_successfully | aaa21add-a13e-42f6-854b-34e0a3617ed3 |

Use an absolute file path: Instead of using a relative file path like `[BA/IFRS16/IFRS16 Contract Valuation/202303 01 REISCN - Contract.XLSX]`, you can try using an absolute file path that includes the full directory path to the file.

First, get a list of all the files in the directory using the `FileList()` function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               | 2. Then, use a `For Each` loop to iterate through each file in the list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               | 3. Inside the loop, use a `LOAD` statement to load the contents of each file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |

In Qlik Sense, you cannot use the FileList function without creating a new connection or directory. However, you can achieve the desired result using an external script to generate a list of file names and then load them into Qlik Sense. Here's a step-by-step guide using a Python script:                                                                                                                                                        | finished_successfully | aaa2aca5-5bb4-4bbf-a2aa-f472739287ab |

In Qlik Sense, you can use the following approach to load all Excel files in a folder with different sheet names:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | finished_successfully | aaa2a32a-d1c8-4da8-bb6b-7523355ec7a4 |

You're right, Qlik Sense doesn't directly support wildcards for loading multiple files. However, you can still achieve your goal using the filelist() function in the Qlik Sense script. Here's the correct approach:                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | finished_successfully | aaa2a8de-7b66-43a0-9daa-de5813bc04fc |

However, you can add a folder with at least one file in it. To add a folder to your Git project, follow these steps:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | finished_successfully | aaa27987-7942-44ec-af1e-631ccbcfb255 |
