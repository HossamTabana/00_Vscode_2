Check SQL Server Agent: Ensure that the SQL Server Agent service is running and properly configured on the SQL Server where the job is defined. The SQL Server Agent is responsible for executing scheduled jobs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

Load Data from the SSIS Package: Instead of executing the SQL job directly in Power BI, you can execute the SSIS package separately using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) tools or SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). Once the package has executed and generated the desired data, you can then connect Power BI to the resulting data source and load it into your report.                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

Use Custom R or Python Scripts: If the SSIS package generates output that can be accessed via SQL queries, you can leverage the R or Python integration capabilities in Power BI. You can write custom scripts in R or Python to execute the necessary SQL queries and retrieve the output from the SSIS package. These scripts can then be incorporated into your Power BI report to fetch the required data.                                                                                                                                                  |                       |                                      |

If `rowcount` is greater than 0, it means the job has finished and the status is set to 'Updated'. Otherwise, it is assumed that the job is still running, and the status is set to 'Running'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

A Pandas DataFrame is created with columns for 'Status' and 'Timestamp'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

The status and timestamp of the job execution are appended to the DataFrame using the `append()` method.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

Finally, the DataFrame is printed to display the results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

To capture both the 'Running' status and the 'Updated' status in separate rows of the Pandas DataFrame, you can modify the script as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | finished_successfully | aaa244cc-dcc3-4544-8940-bac7c4098b86 |

After executing the SQL job, the 'Running' status and timestamp are added to the DataFrame.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

The script then enters a loop where it checks the job execution status at intervals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

The `SELECT` statement retrieves the `last_run_outcome` from the `sysjobs` table to determine if the job has finished. A value of 1 indicates success.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |

If the job has finished, the loop breaks, and the 'Updated' status and timestamp are added to the DataFrame.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

You can use an alternative method to check the job execution status by querying the `sysjobhistory` table. Here's an updated version of the script:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | finished_successfully | aaa265e8-6be9-45d0-872b-61c4c4cca0be |

Power BI's primary function is data visualization and reporting, not transactional or operational database activities. However, there are workarounds to achieve what you need.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | finished_successfully | 32a5b555-97b7-4ba0-86e1-867efaae3c6b |

You can set up a flow that triggers a stored procedure in SQL Server, which in turn executes the job. Here's a high-level overview of how to set this up:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

However, you might be able to use a Power Automate flow to send an email or Teams message when the data has refreshed. It's not an immediate pop-up, but it's a way to notify users.

However, SQL is not designed to do calculations within string values. If your "Version" column has values like "[0006_OR]*[0013_OR]+[0007_OR]*[0014_OR]+[0008_OR]*[0015_OR])" and you want to evaluate this as a mathematical expression, it's not something SQL is capable of doing directly.                                                                                                                                                                      | finished_successfully | aaa2382b-a031-4429-ab9e-f0283ea584f1 |

In this case, you can use subqueries to achieve your goal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | finished_successfully | aaa20a58-b038-4d36-b674-b22f49a98085 |

However, SQL does not support direct calculations across rows. Each row is treated as an independent entity, so in order to perform calculations across multiple rows, you would generally use aggregate functions like `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | finished_successfully | aaa25c72-a2d9-4771-9c12-de163d486353 |

Power BI supports a subset of SQL commands, and unfortunately, the "EXEC" command to execute stored procedures is one of the commands it doesn't support. Power BI has a limit on the types of SQL operations it can perform, as it is primarily a tool for data analysis and visualization, not a full SQL client.                                                                                   | finished_successfully | aaa29dc6-8335-4597-9c75-f2a44a1d3196 |

Power BI doesn't support the direct execution of stored procedures that require the "EXEC" or "{CALL}" command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | finished_successfully | aaa2492c-a8ef-44e4-be1c-9b3f8674dcaa |

As previously suggested, one way is to use Power Automate (previously Microsoft Flow) or Power Apps to execute the stored procedure, possibly triggering this from a user action in Power BI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

It's important to understand these risks and consult with a database administrator or IT security specialist as necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

However, keep in mind that checking the status immediately after starting the job may not give you the actual status, because the job may take some time to complete. You may need to add some delay or repeatedly check the status until it changes.                                                                                                                                                                   | finished_successfully | aaa23c69-3f0b-4502-80eb-4c5ee5a3985a |

The correct column name to check the job execution status from the `sysjobactivity` table is `run_requested_date` and `stop_execution_date`.

The `NOLOCK` hint allows SQL Server to ignore the normal lock that a SQL select query would use and it does not issue shared locks and it does not honor exclusive locks.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | finished_successfully | aaa2c618-4fc1-4780-bce1-18a1dc95be5e |

Since '-28103.675' is a decimal number, it cannot be cast to an integer. You should cast it to `decimal` or `float` instead, depending on your needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | finished_successfully | aaa22740-e785-4a95-82c8-8ca2d2907bf8 |

This will create a new column called `StartOfMonth` representing the first day of each month.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

Sometimes, packages can get corrupted during the installation process, which could lead to these kinds of issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                       |                                      |

VS Code uses the PATH to find the Python interpreter and any associated packages. If the directory where your Python interpreter and packages are located isn't in your PATH, VS Code won't be able to find them. You can check your PATH variable by typing `echo $PATH` (on Unix-like OS) or `echo %PATH%` (on Windows) in your terminal.                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

Indexes essentially create ordered lookup tables that the database search engine can use to speed up the data retrieval process. Make sure to create indexes based on your query patterns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                       |                                      |

This is helpful especially when you only need a subset of your data. This way, Power BI only has to load the view instead of the entire table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

This allows the heavy lifting to be performed at the data source level, rather than in Power BI. Try to perform transformations that support query folding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

If your data is too large, this can consume a lot of resources. On the other hand, DirectQuery mode allows Power BI to query the data directly from the source database, instead of loading it into Power BI. The caveat is that DirectQuery mode may also cause performance issues if your SQL server cannot handle the volume of queries or if the network latency is high. Consider using a Dual mode to balance between the two. |                       |                                      |

This will only refresh the newly added data rather than reloading the entire dataset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

Only pull in the columns you need, and try to reduce the data type size if possible. For example, if you have a numerical column that only contains small numbers, consider converting it from a 64-bit integer data type to a 16-bit integer to save memory.                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

Aggregations work by summarizing a detailed table into an aggregation table. The summarized data in the aggregation table uses                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                       |                                      |

The tool is excellent for visualizations but not necessarily meant for handling huge volumes of data. Here are some strategies you can apply to enhance your performance:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | finished_successfully | 52690d62-9303-4243-bcf4-90bbe257da88 |

Avoid using "SELECT * FROM [Table]" queries, especially for tables with many columns and millions of rows. Instead, specify the columns you need in your SQL query.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

This allows Power BI to only load the necessary data in your visuals. Additionally, consider flattening your data (denormalizing it) when it makes sense to reduce the number of necessary joins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

This way, you're only loading new or changed data in each refresh.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

This can improve I/O performance because SQL Server needs to read fewer pages from disk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

Make sure your queries are optimized to take advantage of these indexes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |
|      |                                      |               |               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

This will reduce the size of the data model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

Instead of pulling in every row, you could create aggregated tables with key metrics already calculated. This is also available as a feature in Power BI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

For example, instead of using `SELECT * FROM [Table]`, you could use `SELECT Column1, Column2, ... FROM [Table]`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

This can help reduce data duplication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                       |                                      |

You can define parameters like `RangeStart` and `RangeEnd` and then filter your query based on these parameters. Only the rows where the date is between these two parameters will be loaded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

These are summary tables based on your detail data. Aggregations allow Power BI to retrieve answers from much smaller tables, which speeds up performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

Use measures instead of calculated columns whenever possible, and keep your visuals simple.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |

SQL Server uses statistics to create query plans that improve performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

This is particularly beneficial if your data grows over time (like transactional data), as it prevents Power BI from loading the entire dataset each time you refresh, and instead only loads the new or changed data. Here's how you can do it:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

Avoid unnecessary visuals or complex calculations in DAX. The more straightforward the report, the faster it will load. Also, consider using DirectQuery if your data source supports it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                       |                                      |

Partitioning can break your table into smaller, more manageable parts and can help to improve query performance. You will need assistance from a DBA for this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a partitioned table in SQL Server:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | finished_successfully | 93d9d406-330d-404e-9a66-5781db353e9a |

If you're altering an existing table, you can use the `CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX` statement to move the data to the partitions.

It can speed up specific queries that are designed to take advantage of partitioning, but other queries could become slower. Therefore, it's crucial to thoroughly test the impact of partitioning on all relevant aspects of your database workload.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

This typically involves providing some basic information about your application (like its name and redirect URI), after which you'll be given a client ID and client secret. These values are used to identify your application in future interactions with Qlik Sense.                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

This will allow them to log in and grant your application permission to access their data. Once they've done this, they will be redirected back to your application along with an authorization code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

This token represents your application's authorization to access the user's data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |
