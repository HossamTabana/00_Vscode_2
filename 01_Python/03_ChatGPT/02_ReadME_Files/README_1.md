This permission will allow the user to see the T-SQL code behind the view without being able to modify it.                                                                                                                                                             | finished_successfully | f51bf072-2a25-4f6d-afa4-a779d49f6de0 |

If there were any specific objects (like certain views or tables) where the user had `VIEW DEFINITION` permission granted individually, those permissions would remain. If you want to ensure the user doesn't have `VIEW DEFINITION` on any object in the database, you'd have to revoke it for each object separately.                              |                       |                                      |

This is common when you, for example, create a new GitLab project and initialize it with a README, `.gitignore`, or license file. Your local branch is out of sync with the remote, and Git wants to avoid overwriting changes.                                                                           | finished_successfully | aaa2fa94-8a3c-421e-8189-b5d90a64424a |

You should not place actual AWS credentials (e.g., access keys) in your Python code or configuration files for security reasons. AWS SSO and AWS CLI manage the retrieval of temporary credentials for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

If you use a credential helper, check the documentation for it. If you don't use a helper, you might be asked for your credentials every time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                       |                                      |

SSH keys can provide a more seamless authentication experience. However, this would require you to have SSH keys set up on your machine and added to your GitLab account.                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

However, this approach is essentially equivalent to the `set-url` command, so there's generally no need to do it this way unless you're troubleshooting:                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

GitLab has a command-line tool called `gitlab` (often referred to as the GitLab CLI) that provides a range of functionalities for interacting with GitLab instances. However, as of my last update in September 2021, GitLab's CLI is not as extensive as Git's. Still, I'll outline some of the common operations users might perform on GitLab, primarily using the `git` command, as GitLab is, at its core, a Git repository manager. | finished_successfully | e8814a19-896a-4cdb-915f-d5c5bc9dc127 |

However, GitHub offers its own set of functionalities, tools, and extensions. One such tool is the GitHub CLI, known as `gh`, which provides a command-line interface to interact with GitHub repositories and features.                                                                                                                                                     | finished_successfully | 5cacfaf7-622a-4b8a-bf0d-4a828aa0cbe9 |

As you mentioned, you've subscribed to Git LFS, but there are still some constraints to consider. Here's what's happening:                                                                                                                                                                                 | finished_successfully | aaa26842-6591-4599-8ce1-448c9696972c |

The warning you see is letting you know that a particular file exceeds GitHub's recommended file size of 50 MB but is still under the 100 MB limit. This is just a warning, and it won't prevent the push.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

Make sure you haven't exceeded this limit. You can check the usage on the GitHub repository settings page.                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

Let's initialize it and then set up LFS tracking:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | finished_successfully | aaa2a390-6eb6-4668-b4f7-b16d10e2c4f6 |

When this occurs, Git prevents the push to ensure that you don't accidentally overwrite changes in the remote repository.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | finished_successfully | aaa29346-ab68-4533-8a82-69cee3fa802f |

However, there are certain points you may need to note when using Databricks:                                                                                                                                                                | finished_successfully | aaa2ac5a-d2d3-42ee-bb0f-750ecfe8676f |

It's not mandatory, but it's an alternative you could consider.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

Here's an example function that accepts a DataFrame, the columns you want to group by to find the max timestamp, the column that holds the timestamp, and any additional filtering conditions you want to apply:                                                                                                                             | finished_successfully | aaa20ae0-6375-40f7-8cd1-76eff5f38274 |

Each filter is a tuple, where the first element is the column name, the second is the operator (e.g., "=", "!="), and the third is the value against which to compare.                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

In PySpark, you don't need backticks for table names.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | finished_successfully | aaa25935-d88e-4552-972a-c12c03ace1a2 |

Python is case-sensitive and variable-specific, so the names must match exactly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | finished_successfully | aaa23bf9-156a-4b3b-ad18-8f38d7de7973 |
