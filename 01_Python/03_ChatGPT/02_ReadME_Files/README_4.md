Ensure that your table does not have circular references (i.e., a child that references a parent that ultimately references the child again), as this would cause an infinite loop in the recursive CTE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |

This assumes that the data you provided in your question is stored in a table with columns `Line_Item_Code`, `Line_Item_Description`, `Number_of_Pipes`, and `Parent_Code`. Adjust field names accordingly if different.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |

However, due to the intricacies of processing plain-text hierarchical data within SQL, there may still be some edge cases to handle, or the code may need further adjustments based on the actual content and structure of the `dbo.zzzz_rowdata` table. If there are inconsistencies, you may need to refine the logic or consider preprocessing the data before inserting it into SQL.                                                                  |                       |                                      |

However, a critical factor affecting performance is the number of records in `dbo.zzzz_rowdata`. If this number is considerably high, the query might still take time. If optimization is still required after this, the issue might be better handled with a procedural approach, such as using a cursor (although this is not always the most optimal approach in terms of performance), or preprocessing the data before inserting into SQL. |                       |                                      |

Instead, the most common approach is to use Snowflake's Python or Spark connectors. This method leverages Snowflake's secure communication without the need for SSH keys.                                                                                                                                                                                              | finished_successfully | aaa26352-df96-4c1d-998b-6901f30937dd |

The `dbutils` library is specific to Databricks and its runtime environment, so you can't use it directly from an external tool like DBeaver.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | finished_successfully | aaa2c418-879f-4c0e-a1a3-dbc2451a94a0 |

This view will derive the hierarchy levels, name, and description from the `RawData` table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

If the current line's hierarchy level is greater than the previous line's, then the previous line is the parent. If it's less, we need to find the closest ancestor with a hierarchy level one less than the current line.                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

The single column you mentioned, `LineContent`, will be the basis for all the processing steps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

However, be cautious while using this option, as it could lead to infinite loops if the recursive CTE is not written correctly. In this case, we have a clear base case and termination condition, so it should be fine.                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

This includes all the packages and libraries installed within that environment. After running this command, the environment will no longer exist, and you'll have freed up the space that it occupied.                                                                                                                                                                                               | finished_successfully | 6dc8946c-abaa-473d-9375-d50274f20afd |

This will give more insight into the issue.

If any exception or error occurs in `check_permissions` that you haven't caught, then this may leave your database connection in an inconsistent state. It's a good practice to use context managers (`with` statements) for this purpose.                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

Consider wrapping parts of your code in a `try...except` block to catch any potential issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

If you are suspecting an issue with them, I recommend running the script step by step and maybe printing out the values at each stage, especially the `user_id` and its type, to ensure that the values are as expected.                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

Replace `YourTableName` with the actual name of your table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

If you are using an earlier version, you'll need an alternative approach for the string aggregation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |

If two rows have the exact same `Datetime` for the same `Cost group`, the `MAX` function will just get the highest value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                       |                                      |

It may not be ideal for all use cases, and its usability largely depends on how often your `Datetime` values change and how often you are okay with running the stored procedure to update the view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                       |                                      |

If your data is daily, this will typically be 1, but if there's any gap in the data, it will reflect that gap.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                       |                                      |
