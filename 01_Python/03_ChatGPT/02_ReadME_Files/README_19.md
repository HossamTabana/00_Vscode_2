However, you can use Parameters to store these sensitive details which would make it somewhat less apparent and reduce the risk of exposure. Parameters could be created from Power Query Editor using the "Manage Parameters" option and can be used throughout the script.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | finished_successfully | 2c86f937-d04a-4a9d-a74b-29a9d715c336 |

I'm familiar with managing these settings through the QMC's security rules but I'm unable to access this function in the development environment.

Aggregate functions such as `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG` etc., cannot be used in the `WHERE` clause. To filter the results based on the count, you need to use the `HAVING` clause which is specifically designed for this purpose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | finished_successfully | aaa207ea-8c3a-4bf0-a631-7c63f300b956 |

In SQL Server, you typically can't return a table directly from a stored procedure, but you can insert the result into a table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                       |                                      |

If your stored procedure is already designed to return a success or error status, you can capture that status and insert it into a table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

You may want to consider using a dataflow or a data warehouse approach, where data extraction and transformation are done ahead of time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Power BI Service cannot directly refresh a Python script and doesn't have a native Python runtime to execute Python code. This poses a problem as the Power BI Service won't be able to get the updated data from the API using the Python script.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | finished_successfully | aaa2b945-6036-4eee-8245-2c40bff687d3 |

Power BI can then directly connect to this database/storage for the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                       |                                      |

As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the Web connector (which is generally used to connect to APIs) is not available directly in Power BI Dataflows. It seems there was a mistake in the previous steps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | finished_successfully | aaa2b8b2-c97d-4185-8170-917510db4b9c |

As mentioned earlier, dataflows currently only support a limited set of authentication methods. For complex scenarios, you may need to use an alternate method, like Azure Functions, Logic Apps, or a Power Automate flow to retrieve the data and store it somewhere that dataflows can connect to (like Azure Data Lake Storage).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |

However, Power BI does not directly support advanced authentication mechanisms such as OAuth2 used in your Python script. For complex scenarios, you would typically have to use an alternate method like Azure Functions, Logic Apps, or Power Automate flow to retrieve the data and store it somewhere that Power BI can connect to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | finished_successfully | aaa298c6-5f20-4cd7-b4ef-307b6afa883d |

Power BI can handle basic authentications natively, but for OAuth2 or similar protocols, we generally need to resort to intermediary services that can handle such authentications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                       |                                      |

Then call this Azure function from Power BI. This effectively turns your API call into a web request without any authentication because the Azure function handles it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                       |                                      |

Then you can get Power BI to load the data from there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                                      |

Then connect Power BI to this database. This way, Power BI doesn't need to interact with the API directly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                       |                                      |

You can install this gateway in your local environment, where the Python script is located.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                       |                                      |

The script would fetch the data from the API and store it in a database, like Azure SQL Database or Azure Data Lake Storage. Power BI can then connect to this database to fetch the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

This can be triggered from your Python script wherever it's hosted, even from cloud-based computing environments such as Azure Functions or AWS Lambda.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | finished_successfully | 3cb7b97c-1fcf-477f-a7e8-df35782ae718 |

They can follow the steps to create the Azure AD app registration, set the permissions, and provide you with the necessary client ID, tenant ID, and client secret.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | finished_successfully | aaa2215f-4ce6-4cec-9e09-1846735eaf93 |

Power Automate can trigger a Power BI refresh upon some event, like when a file is updated in OneDrive or SharePoint, or on a schedule. It's worth mentioning that Power Automate doesn't provide the same level of flexibility as a custom Python script and also requires certain permissions, but it's an alternative you could explore.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

You could potentially trigger a refresh of the report's data through this API, but this would require the report or dashboard to be embedded in an application and still requires appropriate permissions to the report or dashboard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                       |                                      |

This might be due to some conflicting DLLs in your system path. Check if you have multiple versions of Python installed, and if so, ensure that the PATH variable in your system environment variables is correctly set to the Python version you're using in Anaconda.

You can create a new environment with the command `conda create -n myenv python=3.9` (replace "myenv" with your desired environment name). Activate the environment with `conda activate myenv`, then install your packages in this environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

For the users to be able to refresh reports in real time, we require the installation and configuration of an on-premises gateway (the standard version, not the personal one) on server KFICWPNXDBSP01. There might be a necessity to enable specific ports and set the connection to run via Illumio.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

Therefore, it would be ideal if you could coordinate with the IT team and the relevant parties from Illumio. Alternatively, you could arrange a group meeting at the earliest convenience to facilitate this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                       |                                      |

If this is the case, consider slowing down your requests or implementing some delay between them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

Make sure you are using an updated version of these libraries. Also, check if there are any known issues related to these libraries and the error you are encountering.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                       |                                      |

Power Automate could run your Python script on an Azure Function or similar platform, then refresh the Power BI dataset once the Python script has finished running. However, this requires some additional setup and may not be suitable for all situations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

In SQL, you need to be careful when you want to use the results of aggregation functions (like SUM) in mathematical expressions because the operations do not distribute over the aggregation. You should calculate the sums first and then use the results in your formula. Also, since there is a possibility of division by zero, you should handle that as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | finished_successfully | aaa23039-094d-4fed-bfaa-b7822e47dfd2 |

The `CASE` statement is used to avoid division by zero. If the sum of the weights is zero, the result of the formula is set to zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                       |                                      |

It's an open-source storage layer that brings ACID transactions (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) to Apache Spark and big data workloads. It provides a simpler way to store and process large amounts of data, and to prepare it for analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | finished_successfully | c64f1e7b-2627-4f48-97d5-e42eeb859238 |

In the example above, I assumed that you wanted to sum all the '10le' values, sum all the '20ma' values, and sum all the '30mn' values, then multiply the sum of '20ma' with the sum of '30mn' and add the result to the sum of '10le' values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                       |                                      |

If there is, it treats the operands as different data types and calculates the product of their sums from the `Value` column. If not, it sums the values corresponding to that `Data`. The sums are then added together and returned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                       |                                      |

However, it's important to note that the CASE statement would only be effective if you have a predetermined set of data values you're looking for, as it's not possible to perform operations on multiple rows in SQL with the CASE statement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | finished_successfully | 20104f04-3d8b-4ef1-957f-7eea55e55060 |

The value for each row is either the `Value` associated with '10le', the `Value` associated with '20ma', or the `Value` associated with '30mn', or 0 if the `Data` value doesn't match any of these.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                       |                                      |

The `CASE` statements inside the `SUM` function then handle the calculation of the 'Value' column for each matching 'Data' value. This view will provide the sum of 'Value' for '10le' plus the product of sums for '20ma' and '30mn', grouped by 'Month' and 'Version'. Please replace `your_table` and `your_view` with your actual table and view names.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                       |                                      |

You can pass the calculation you need as a parameter to the stored procedure and dynamically build the SQL query string using that parameter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | finished_successfully | fcccaaa3-13e7-4e59-aab7-9505f730c05a |

It is important to carefully test and adjust the script to make sure it works correctly with your specific use case. Always ensure to replace `your_table` and `your_view` with your actual table and view names. The syntax might vary depending on your SQL environment. If you're not using SQL Server, you will need to adjust the syntax accordingly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

If you're using Python scripts in Power BI, you should also make sure that the data source is set up properly for refresh. If you're connecting to a local file or database, you might need to set up a gateway for data refresh.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                                      |

In the union of two queries, the column order must match in both queries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                       |                                      |

The 'CL Scheme' column seems to be static in the second query, so I removed it from the `GROUP BY` clause.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                                      |

This is potentially due to how the SQL logic is being processed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | finished_successfully | aaa28e0e-fa75-409f-8d6f-a4ac85e6864b |

The `Rules` field in the first part of your `UNION ALL` is set as `'0'`, and in the second part it is set as `'1'`, so if everything works as expected, you should only see '0' or '1' as a result of your `SELECT DISTINCT` query. However, you're seeing float values instead, which suggests that something else is happening.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                                      |

You are then grouping by several fields. You might be seeing different values in the `Rules` field if you have multiple records with the same fields you're grouping by, causing a sum of `[REP CL Scheme]` to be shown instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                       |                                      |

The problem is that the column order is not matching in the two SELECT statements of the UNION ALL. The SQL UNION operation requires the same number of expressions (columns) in the SELECT statements being united, and they must be of the same data type, and in the same order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | finished_successfully | aaa294bd-b681-4a51-9969-8af401d0b92d |

Hence, when the UNION ALL operation is performed, the 'Rules_' column in the second SELECT is incorrectly mapping to the 'REP CL Scheme' column in the first SELECT, and vice versa. That's why you are seeing those decimal values when querying for 'Rules_' - you are actually seeing the values of 'REP CL Scheme'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                                      |

Are you looking to replicate an already existing application in DEV or are you planning to create a brand new application? If it's the latter, please note that you may not automatically have a connection to the data source. To ensure we fully understand your needs and provide the best solution, could we possibly arrange a brief conversation?

The way we're checking if the job has finished is rather basic and might not work perfectly in all cases. For example, if the job takes a long time to start, we might miss its start and think it's already completed. Also, if the job can run more than once at the same time, we might check the status of the wrong instance of the job.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                       |                                      |

The loop condition checks for the `run_status` of the most recent job execution in the job history. This can cause issues if a new job execution starts before the script has detected that the previous one has finished, especially when the job runs frequently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | finished_successfully | aaa28023-a729-4aff-bcfb-050a0a4b3e52 |

The solution provided uses a simple approach that may not work correctly in all scenarios. However, you can potentially refine this approach by adding more conditions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | finished_successfully | aaa231bc-889e-4d19-87cd-a294638df6e9 |

This is done by comparing the `run_date` and `run_time` fields of the job history with the current date and time when we started the job.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                                      |
